   *
   * A component that *tries* to hide itself from screen-readers, absolutely

   * using something like a ScreenReaderContent component.
   *
   * Be warned that this does not totally prevent all screen-readers from
   * seeing this content in all modes. For example, VoiceOver in OS X will
   * still see this element when running in the "Say-All" mode and read it
   * along with the accessible version you're providing.
   *
   * > **Warning**
   * >
   * > Use of this component is discouraged unless there's no alternative!!!
   * >
   * > The only one case that justifies its use is when design provides a
   * > totally inaccessible version of a resource, and you're trying to
   * > accommodate the design (for sighted users,) and provide a genuine layer
   * > of accessibility (for others.)
