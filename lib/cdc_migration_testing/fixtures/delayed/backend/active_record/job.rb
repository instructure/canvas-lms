module CdcFixtures
  def self.create_job
    # The model-generator can successfully auto-create a delayed job model.
    # However, this causes a problem when a PluginSetting model is created.
    # When a PluginSetting is created, it also creates a delayed job (the
    # inst-jobs gem does this automatically), and that job gets an id of 1
    # for some reason, even though a job with id=1 already exists. The new job
    # id doesn't get auto-incremented to 2.
    # I couldn't figure out why that was happening, so this is a workaround.
    # Manually create a delayed job here, with an id of 2, so that the
    # other job created along with the PluginSetting can use id 1.
    return Delayed::Backend::ActiveRecord::Job.new(
      id: 2,
      run_at: Time.zone.now,
