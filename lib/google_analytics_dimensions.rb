  # Prepare some contextual data to supplement a pageview hit when submitting to
  # GA to provide the analyst with more context surrounding the request:
  #
  #     {
  #       "enrollments": BoolMask.<student, teacher, observer>,
  #       "admin": BoolMask.<admin, site_admin>,
  #       "masquerading": Bool
  #     }
  #
  # Bool is a "0" or "1" value (encoded as strings) while "BoolMask" is a stream
  # of bools encoded also as a string. For example:
  #
  #     {
  #       "enrollments": "010", # a teacher
  #       "admin": "11",        # an admin and a site admin
  #       "masquerading": "0"   # nope
  #     }
  #
  # Encoding flags in such a way gives us the flexibility to represent future
  # values while also giving the analyst more freedom in reporting (GA supports
  # regex filtering.)
