# to add smart search to a model:
#  1. `include SmartSearchable`
#  2. `use_smart_search` and supply the title and body columns
#     as well as the scopes used for indexing (->(course) {...})
#     and searching (->(course, user), {...})
#  3. create the embeddings model and table (with fk/index)

# model requirements:
#  1. Course association
#  2. uses Workflow
#  3. SoftDeletable
