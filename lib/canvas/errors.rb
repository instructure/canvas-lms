module Canvas
  # The central message bus for errors in canvas.
  #
  # This class is injected both in ApplicationController for capturing
  # exceptions that happen in request/response cycles, and in our
  # Delayed::Job callback for failed jobs.  We also call out to it
  # from several points throughout the codebase directly to register
  # an unexpected occurance that doesn't necessarily bubble up to
  # that point.
  #
  # There's a sentry connector built into canvas, but anything one
  # wants to do with errors can be hooked into this path with the
  # .register! method.
  class Errors

    # normally we would alias Errors to be CanvasErrors
    # as the shim, but we have several other classes actually inside
    # lib/canvas/errors/*.rb that need the existing module structure,
    # so method_missing works better at the moment.

      def method_missing(m, *args, &block)
        CanvasErrors.send(m, *args, &block)
      end
