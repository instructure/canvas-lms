module Canvas::Security
  # This was originally part of Canvas::Security directly
  # as the module method "re_encrypt_data", but with it's
  # dependencies on Models and PluginSetting, it couldn't
  # be extracted to the "canvas_security" gem, which
  # is why it now lives in it's own module.
  #
  # This operation spans all the data on a shard that is encrypted
  # in the db, decrypts it, and re-encrypts again using the same
  # key but a different salt.  This is useful in cases where, for
  # example, we're moving data between databases, and we want the
  # VALUE to remain the same at the moment but don't want the old salt present in
  # the previous database to have any utility for decrypting the
  # value from the new database.
