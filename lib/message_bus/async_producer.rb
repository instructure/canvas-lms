  # thrown if production to the pulsar instance is so
  # throttled that the queue has grown to the max size
  # and we're still trying to push new messages on.
  # Better to have a max queue size and exhibit back
  # pressure predictably than to have an unbounded queue
  # (in which case memory consumption could grow until
  #  it became significant enough to impede general request
  # servicing).

  # Internal: Background worker for queueing up
  # writes to the pulsar message bus in memory.
  # this should help prevent operational issues on
  # the pulsar side from creating too much backpressure
  # at the canvas level.  Note that messages written this
  # way have less guarantees about making it to pulsar than ones
  # written synchronously (which will error if they fail).
  # A catastrophic machine failure could dump events still in
  # the memory queue.
