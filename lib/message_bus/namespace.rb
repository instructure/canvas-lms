# Namespaces in a pulsar instance can be shared
# across clusters for topic replication, but need
# distinct namespaces in each cluster if you intend
# to support disjoint topic sets in each "same-purposed"
# namespace.  This class exists to ensure that if
# canvas has a regional code, it gets included as part of
# namespace specification in working with the message bus library.
#
# In an open-source/single-tenant canvas installation,
# the regional config will be nil, and no suffix need be applied.
