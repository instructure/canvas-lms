# Class concerned with finding available ContextExternalTools for a particular
# context, with other possible options. Looks in the context and parents, which
# may include a federated parent, so tools may be on another shard.

    # * if the scope uses an order, it will apply to each scope in the scope union separately

    #   is [on shard 1] CET.where(id: 1), and contexts_to_search are on shard 1 and shard2,
    #   the ScopeUnion will have [shard 1] CET.where(id: 1) and [shard 2] CET.where(id: 10000000000001)
