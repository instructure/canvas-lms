module Api::V1::Json
  # go through this helper for all json serialization in the api -- it handles
  # some tasks that all api json should do, like not including the root wrapper
  # object, and passing the user permissions info into the serialization engine.
  #
  # if no user/session is given, permissions will not be considered during
  # serialization! make sure that's ok.
  #
  # this returns the ruby hash of the json data, not the raw json string. you can still pass that hash to render like
  # render :json => hash
  # and it'll be stringified properly.
