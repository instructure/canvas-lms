require 'hashery/dictionary'

# Contains a dictionary of arrays with hashes in them. This is so that
# we can get all the submissions for a course grouped by date and
# ordered by date, person, then assignment.  Since working with this is
# a loop in a loop in a loop, it gets a little awkward for controllers
# and views, so I contain it in a class with some helper methods.  The
# dictionary comes from facets, a stable and mature library that's been
# around for years.  A dictionary is just an ordered hash.
#
# To use this:
#
# s = SubmissionList.new(course)
# s.each {|e| # lists each submission hash in the right order }
# s.each_day {|e| # lists each day with an array of submission hashes }
#
# The submission hash has some very useful meta data in there:
#
# :grader => printable name of the grader, or Graded on submission if unknown
# :grader_id => user_id of the grader
# :previous_grade => the grade previous to this one, or nil
# :current_grade => the most current grade, the last submission for this assignment and student
# :new_grade => the new grade this submission received
# :assignment_name => a printable name of the assignment
# :student_user_id => the user_id of the student
# :course_id => the course id
# :assignment_id => the assignment id
# :student_name => a printable name of the student
# :graded_on => the day (not the time) the submission was made
# :score_before_regrade => the score prior to regrading
#
# The version data is actually pulled from some yaml storage through
# simply_versioned.
