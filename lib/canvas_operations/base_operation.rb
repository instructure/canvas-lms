module CanvasOperations
  # BaseOperation
  #
  # Base operation class that acts as a parent for all canvas operations.
  #
  # Operations are bound to a single Switchman shard to ensure consistency during
  # execution (example: data cached in instance variables may not be valid if the currentshard changes).
  #
  # Subclasses should override the `execute` method to implement their specific operation logic.
  # They can also override methods like `singleton`, `context`, and others to customize behavior
  #
  # Subclasses can also use `<before|after|around>_run` and `<before|after|around>_failure` callbacks to hook into
  # the operation lifecycle.
  #
  # This class provides a consistent set of behaviors to all operations:
  #   - Binding operations to a single shard
  #   - Consistent logging via `#log_message`
  #   - Progress tracking via the `Progress` model
  #   - Standardized error handling and reporting
  #   - Integration with InstStatsd for event emission (start, complete, failure)
  #   - Configurable settings via class-level `setting` definitions, backed by the `Setting` model
  #
  # See `./data_fixup.rb` for an example subclass implementation.
