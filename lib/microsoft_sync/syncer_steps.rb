# starting place to understand the syncing process.
# See also MicrosoftSync::Group model.
#
# This ideally shouldn't contain much job plumbing (retry logic, strands, state
# storage, etc.), but focus on the business logic about what to do in each step
# of a sync. For job plumbing, see StateMachineJob. This should normally be
# used by creating a StateMachineJob with this as the steps_object; see
# MicrosoftSync::Group#syncer_job

    # This number is fairly arbitrary but it should be small enough that
    # we can get all the enrollments from the DB in one fetch.  Also, given a
    # max course size of 25k, this means that in the worst case, triggering a
