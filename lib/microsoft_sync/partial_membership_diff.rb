# Encapsulates the logic of comparing the local course enrollments and
# PartialSyncChanges, and based on these calculating the requests necessary to
# update the group on the Microsoft side. Similar to MembershipDiff, but that
# is for a full sync (where we actually get the list of group users from
# Microsoft), whereas this only calculates changes for the users in
# user_id_to_msft_role_types which we get from PartialSyncChanges: that is, we
# only update group membership for users whose enrollments have recently
# changed.
#
# Note that, in certain situations (such as adding and removing a user in the
# same time period), because we don't know the state on the Microsoft side,
# this may indicate unnecessary changes (such as removing a user from a group
# it is not in); by executing the actions recommended by this class with
# GraphService's remove_group_users_ignore_missing(), such actions turn into
# no-ops.
# For instance, here is an example where what seems like the "optimal" method
# could lead to us never adding an owner. You can check that the actions we
# actually implement below (MEMBER_MSFT_ROLE_TYPE_ACTIONS[%w[member owner]] and
# OWNER_MSFT_ROLE_TYPE_ACTIONS[%w[member]] are redundant but do not have the
# issue.
#
# 1. STUDENT enrollment added
# 2. Partial sync job starts. Gets the list of changes and starts looking up user
#    mappings and enrollments.
# 3. TEACHER enrollment added while Partial Sync job is running
# 4. In job: we have just 1 PartialSyncChange, of type "member", but current
#    enrollments are of member AND owner (Student and Teacher)
#    "Optimal" but wrong: we assume Teacher enrollment was there already so user
#    was already a member and not do anything.
# 5. After job finishes, but before next job starts, TeacherEnrollment is
#   removed.
# 6. Job starts with 1 PartialSyncChange of "owner", but current enrollments are
#    of type member (Student)
# 7. "Optimal" but wrong: We assume just owner was removed. We remove the users
#    as an owner but we assume member has not changed (it was there already) so
#    don't change it. We will never add the user as a member.
