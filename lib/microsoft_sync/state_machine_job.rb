# Object which extracts the logic of a multi-step job which may retry at each
# step of the job. Each step may need to pass on data to the next step; if any
# step fails, it may be retried, stashing data in job_state on a record or
# somewhere else (see stash_block below).
#
# After initializing, you will want to run with `run_later` or (for debugging
# in a console) `run_synchronously`. Either of these can take an initial
# mem_state argument, which is useful if you have different flavors of jobs that
# need to run on the same strand (and not start until the one currently
# running/retrying has finished). IMPORTANT: if you use non-primitives in
# initial_mem_state, deduping of backlogged jobs will not work; see
# find_delayed_job (and its usage)
#
# The job runs on a strand tied to the state_record which means only one job
# may be running at a time. In addition, if new a job is started while a job
# is in-progress, it will be rescheduled for after the current job finishes
# (unless another new job with the same initial_mem_state is already eneueued)
#
# STATES:
# When a job is running:
#   job_state_record.workflow_state is "running"
# When a job has hit a retriable error:
#   job_state_record.workflow_state is "retrying"
#   job_state_record.job_state is information about the step that failed,
#       and data it may need to continue where it left off. There may be other
#       temporary data in the DB with retry info (e.g. saved with a stash block
#       and cleaned up in after_failure())
# After a job has hit a final error (error raised, or max `Retry`s surpassed):
#   job_state_record.workflow_state is "errored"
#   job_state_record.last_error will have a user-friendly/safe error message
#   job_state_record.job_state will be clear
# After a job has completed successfully
#   job_state_record.workflow_state is "completed"
#   job_state_record.last_error, job_state will be clear
