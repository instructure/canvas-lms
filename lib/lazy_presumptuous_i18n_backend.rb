# Based off of I18n::Backend::Simple, this backend makes a presumption about
# your locale files -- with the exception of `locales.yml`, every locale file
# should contain exactly one top-level key, and the file's name (minus the
# `.yml` extension) should be the same as that key. If you follow this
# convention, then this backend will lazy-load your languages. This can cut
# down dramatically on app initialization time (~35%) at the expense of a
# little delay (less than 1 second in local tests) the first time each new
# language is queried (which, in places like dev environments, targeted test
# runs, and rails console usage, is typically never).
#
# One more presumption: `meta_keys` are only stored in `locales.yml`. We
# eager-extract those so that they can be fetched without triggering a
# lazy-load of the entire locale. This accommodates methods like those found in
# the `LocaleSelection` module.
#
# There's a fair amount of copy-pasta from I18n::Backend::Simple in here that
# just replaces `translations` with `lazy_translations`. That's because the
# former is used in a few places (specs and rake tasks, incuding a task from
# i18nliner) that expect it to return the full set of translations for all
# languages. Therefore we avoid invoking `translations` in most places and
# instead use `lazy_translations` whenever possible, which only provides
# strings that have already been loaded.
