// the purpose of this file is to define a Date.prototype.toISOString method that doesn't return 
// things like ""2011-02-16T19:00:00Z"" but rather "2011-02-16T19:00:00Z"
// date.js thought it was just using json.org's implementation but was actually adding extra quotes.
// by defineing it here date.js will use it and not define it itself.  for any good browser (not IE) 
// it will use the native toISOString method supplied by the browser.
// 
// this file is the same as http://code.google.com/p/datejs/source/browse/trunk/src/core.js but with 
// the beginning and ending quotes on the return string removed
