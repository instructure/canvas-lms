          In order to make it easier for users, rather than forcing them to download things like Word docs, PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, and open office documents (In addition to requiring that those programs be installed on their on their computer), in many areas throughout Canvas, it will allow you an inline preview of the document.
          
          If Scribd has been enabled for this account, it will try to use it to show the preview. But because Scribd uses flash paper to display the documents, and many users (namely those using an iPad/iPhone) do not have Flash Player installed, that preview will not work.  By leaving Google Docs Previews enabled, when a browser does not have Flash enabled, or if Scribd is not enabled, it will use preview powered by Google Docs. Using this service is subject to Google's viewer [terms of service](%{terms_url})

            Course modules let you organize your assignments, pages, files, etc. into smaller sections or units. Modules could be centered around a theme, focused on a specific topic, or even just grouped chronologically.
            
            You can also sequence modules by defining criteria and prerequisites for each module. Students won't be able to access modules until they have unlocked all their prerequisites. That way you can prevent students from accessing certain content or files until they have, say, gotten at least 75% on a review quiz.

            ePortfolios are a place where you can display and discuss the significant
            submissions and experiences that are happening during your learning
            process. You can use an ePortfolio to:
            
            * Display the papers you're proud of for more than just your instructor to see
            * Talk about all the thought and work that went into your class submissions
            * Gather an overview of your educational experience as a whole
            * Share your work with friends, future employers, etc.
            
            ePortfolios can be public for everyone to see, or private so only those you
            allow can see, and you can change that setting at any time.

          External (LTI) Tools are an easy way to add new features to Canvas.
            They can be added to individual courses, or to all courses in an account.
            Once configured, you can link to them through course modules and create assignments for
            assessment tools.

          You can create sets of groups where students can sign up on their own.
          Students are still limited to being in only one group in the set, but this way
          students can organize themselves into groups instead of needing the teacher to
          do the work. You can also require that group members all be part of the same
          course section.
          
          Keep in mind, students can move themselves from one group to another, so when
          your students are done organizing themselves you may want to disable self
          sign-ups.

          If the institution does not use WebCT's "Learning Modules" (including schools who adopted WebCT
            prior to version 4.0, when modules were made available), course migrations can be improved by importing the "Course Content"
            as Canvas Modules instead of the "Learning Modules". This page allows one to set the default behavior of the WebCT migrator
            with respect to content modules. It is important to remember that, while individual course migrations retain the ability
            to choose, the bulk migrator always utilizes the value configured here and cannot be changed per migration.

You can define intermediate variables in these formulas, but the numerical result of the last formula is what is used to generate the correct answer. For example: %{example} For this set of formulas, the final answer is 71. However, there are no predefined variables, so all students would have the same question with the same answer. See the \"variables\" tab for more information on variables."
      equation_variables: "You can also define variables in you question text using brackets (\"What is [a] + [b]?\"). For every variable, you'll see an \"Example Value\" based on the variable settings. This is so you can check your math and make sure your formulas work. For example, if your question was \"What is [a] + 5?\" then you'd be asked to define the variable \"a\". If the example value for \"a\" were 5.2, you could write: %{example} With this formula you can generate any number of solution sets, with a different value of \"a\" in each set. One student might see the question, \"What is 5.2 + 5?\" and another might see \"What is 9 + 5?\"."
