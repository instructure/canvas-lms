# This can't currently be made compatible with redis cluster, because the Lua functions
# access keys that aren't in their keys argument list (since they pop jobs off
# a queue and then update the job with that id).

# still TODO:
#   * a consequence of our ignore-redis-failures code is that if redis is unavailable, creating delayed jobs silently fails, which is probably not what we want
#   * need a way to migrate between jobs backends
#   * we need some auditors:
#     * fail jobs in running_jobs if they've timed out
#     * have pools audit their workers and immediately fail jobs locked by dead workers (make sure this handles the restart case where two pools are running)
#     * have a master auditor that fails jobs if a whole pool dies
#     * audit strands ocasionally, look for any stuck strands where the strand queue isn't empty but there's no strand job running or queued

  # An overview of where and when things are stored in redis:
  #
  # Jobs are given a UUID for an id, rather than an incrementing integer id.
  # The job attributes are then stored in a redis hash at job/<id>. Attribute
  # values are generally stored as their json representation, except for
  # timestamps, which as stored as floating point utc-time-since-unix-epoch
  # values, so that we can compare timestamps in Lua without a date parser.
  #
  # Jobs that are schedule to run immediately (in the present/past) are
  # inserted into the queue named queue/<queue_name>. The queue is a sorted
  # set, with the value being the job id and the weight being a floating point
  # value, <priority>.<run_at>. This formatting is key to efficient
  # querying of the next job to run.
  #
  # Jobs that are scheduled to run in the future are not inserted into the
  # queue, but rather a future queue named queue/<queue_name>/future. This
  # queue is also a sorted set, with the value being the job id, but the weight
  # is just the <run_at> value.
  #
  # If the job is on a strand, the flow is different. First, it's inserted into
  # a list named strand/<strand>. When strand jobs are inserted into the
  # current jobs queue, we check if they're next to run in the strand. If not,
  # we give them a special priority that is greater than MAX_PRIORITY, so that
  # they won't run.  When a strand job is finished, failed or deleted,
  # "tickle_strand" is called, which removes that job from the list and if that
  # job was at the front of the list, changes the priority on the next job so
  # that it's eligible to run.
  #
  # For singletons, the flow is the same as for other strand jobs, except that
  # the job is thrown out if there are already any non-running jobs in the
  # strand list.
  #
  # If a job fails, it's removed from the normal queues and inserted into the
  # failed_jobs sorted set, with job id as the value and failure time as the
  # key. The hash of job attributes is also renamed from job/<id> to
  # failed_job/<id> -- use Delayed::Job::Failed to query those jobs, same as
  # with AR jobs.
  #
  # We also insert into some other data structures for admin functionality.
  # tag_counts/current and tag_counts/all are sorted sets storing the count of
  # jobs for each tag. tag/<tag> is a set of existing job ids that have that tag.
  #
  # Most all of this happens in Lua functions, for atomicity. See the other
  # files in this directory -- functions.rb is a wrapper to call the lua
  # functions, and the individual functions are defined in .lua files in this
  # directory.

  # these key mappings are duplicated in the redis lua code, in include.lua
