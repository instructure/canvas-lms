      # = AWS SDK Storage Backend
      #
      # Enables use of {Amazon's Simple Storage Service}[http://aws.amazon.com/s3] as a storage mechanism
      #
      # == Requirements
      #
      # Requires the {AWS SDK Library}[https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby] installed either
      # as a gem or a as a Rails plugin.
      #
      # == Configuration
      #
      # Configuration is done via <tt>RAILS_ROOT/config/amazon_s3.yml</tt> and is loaded according to the <tt>RAILS_ENV</tt>.
      # The minimum connection options that you must specify are a bucket name, your access key id and your secret access key.
      # If you don't already have your access keys, all you need to sign up for the S3 service is an account at Amazon.
      # You can sign up for S3 and get access keys by visiting http://aws.amazon.com/s3.
      #
      # Example configuration (RAILS_ROOT/config/amazon_s3.yml)
      # 
      #   development:
      #     bucket_name: appname_development
      #     access_key_id: <your key>
      #     secret_access_key: <your key>
      #   
      #   test:
      #     bucket_name: appname_test
      #     access_key_id: <your key>
      #     secret_access_key: <your key>
      #   
      #   production:
      #     bucket_name: appname
      #     access_key_id: <your key>
      #     secret_access_key: <your key>
      #
      # You can change the location of the config path by passing a full path to the :s3_config_path option.
      #
      #   has_attachment :storage => :s3, :s3_config_path => (RAILS_ROOT + '/config/s3.yml')
      #
      # === Required configuration parameters
      #
      # * <tt>:access_key_id</tt> - The access key id for your S3 account. Provided by Amazon.
      # * <tt>:secret_access_key</tt> - The secret access key for your S3 account. Provided by Amazon.
      # * <tt>:bucket_name</tt> - A unique bucket name (think of the bucket_name as being like a database name).
      #
      # If any of these required arguments is missing, a MissingAccessKey exception will be raised from AWS::S3.
      #
      # == About bucket names
      #
      # Bucket names have to be globally unique across the S3 system. And you can only have up to 100 of them,
      # so it's a good idea to think of a bucket as being like a database, hence the correspondance in this
      # implementation to the development, test, and production environments.
      #
      # The number of objects you can store in a bucket is, for all intents and purposes, unlimited.
      #
      # === Optional configuration parameters
      #
      # * <tt>:server</tt> - The server to make requests to. Defaults to <tt>s3.amazonaws.com</tt>.
      # * <tt>:port</tt> - The port to the requests should be made on. Defaults to 80 or 443 if <tt>:use_ssl</tt> is set.
      # * <tt>:use_ssl</tt> - If set to true, <tt>:port</tt> will be implicitly set to 443, unless specified otherwise. Defaults to false.
      #
      # == Usage
      #
      # To specify S3 as the storage mechanism for a model, set the acts_as_attachment <tt>:storage</tt> option to <tt>:s3</tt>.
      #
      #   class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_attachment :storage => :s3
      #   end
      #
      # === Customizing the path
      #
      # By default, files are prefixed using a pseudo hierarchy in the form of <tt>:table_name/:id</tt>, which results
      # in S3 urls that look like: http(s)://:server/:bucket_name/:table_name/:id/:filename with :table_name
      # representing the customizable portion of the path. You can customize this prefix using the <tt>:path_prefix</tt>
      # option:
      #
      #   class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_attachment :storage => :s3, :path_prefix => 'my/custom/path'
      #   end
      #
      # Which would result in URLs like <tt>http(s)://:server/:bucket_name/my/custom/path/:id/:filename.</tt>
      #
      # === Permissions
      #
      # By default, files are stored on S3 with public access permissions. You can customize this using
      # the <tt>:s3_access</tt> option to <tt>has_attachment</tt>. Available values are 
      # <tt>:private</tt>, <tt>:public_read_write</tt>, and <tt>:authenticated_read</tt>.
      #
      # === Other options
      #
      # Of course, all the usual configuration options apply, such as content_type and thumbnails:
      #
      #   class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_attachment :storage => :s3, :content_type => ['application/pdf', :image], :resize_to => 'x50'
      #     has_attachment :storage => :s3, :thumbnails => { :thumb => [50, 50], :geometry => 'x50' }
      #   end
      #
      # === Accessing S3 URLs
      #
      # You can get an object's URL using the s3_url accessor. For example, assuming that for your postcard app
      # you had a bucket name like 'postcard_world_development', and an attachment model called Photo:
      #
      #   @postcard.s3_url # => http(s)://s3.amazonaws.com/postcard_world_development/photos/1/mexico.jpg
      #
      # The resulting url is in the form: http(s)://:server/:bucket_name/:table_name/:id/:file.
      # The optional thumbnail argument will output the thumbnail's filename (if any).
      #
      # Additionally, you can get an object's base path relative to the bucket root using
      # <tt>base_path</tt>:
      #
      #   @photo.file_base_path # => photos/1
      #
      # And the full path (including the filename) using <tt>full_filename</tt>:
      #
      #   @photo.full_filename # => photos/
      #
      # Niether <tt>base_path</tt> or <tt>full_filename</tt> include the bucket name as part of the path.
      # You can retrieve the bucket name using the <tt>bucket_name</tt> method.
