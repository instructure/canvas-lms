# CanvasErrors isThe central message bus for errors in canvas.
#
# This class can be injected in ApplicationController for capturing
# exceptions that happen in request/response cycles, or in
# Delayed::Job callbacks for failed jobs, etc.
#
# There's a sentry connector built into canvas, but anything one
# wants to do with errors can be hooked into this path with the
# .register! method.

module CanvasErrors

  # register something to happen on every exception that occurs.
  #
  # The parameter is a unique key for this callback, which is
  # used when assembling return values from ".capture" and it's friends.
  #
  # The block should accept three parameters, one for the exception/message
  # and one for contextual info in the form of a hash, and one which is the
  # severity "level" of the exception (defaulting to :error)
  #
  # The contextual hash (2nd parameter) *will*
  # have an ":extra" key, and *may* have a ":tags" key.  tags would
  # be things it might be useful to aggreate errors around (job queue), extras
  # are things that would be useful for tracking down why or in what
  # circumstance an error might occur (request_context_id)
  #
  # The ":level" parameter will be one of a predefined set (see ERROR_LEVELS below),
  # so your callback can decide what to do with it.
  #
  #   CanvasErrors.register!(:my_key) do |ex, data, level|

  # "capture" is the thing to call if you want to tell CanvasErrors
  # that something bad happened.  You can pass in an exception, or
  # just a message.  If you don't build your data hash
  # with a "tags" key and an "extra" key, it will just group all contextual
  # information under "extra"
  #
  # the ":level" parameter, which defaults
  # to ":error" and (much like log levels), can trigger different
  # reporting outcomes in the callbacks. expected member of ERROR_LEVELS.
  # Registered callbacks can decide what to do about different levels.
