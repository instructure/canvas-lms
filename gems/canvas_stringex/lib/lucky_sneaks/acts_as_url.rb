    module ClassMethods # :doc:
      # Creates a callback to automatically create an url-friendly representation
      # of the <tt>attribute</tt> argument. Example:
      #
      #   act_as_url :title
      #
      # will use the string contents of the <tt>title</tt> attribute
      # to create the permalink. <strong>Note:</strong> you can also use a non-database-backed
      # method to supply the string contents for the permalink. Just use that method's name
      # as the argument as you would an attribute.
      #
      # The default attribute <tt>acts_as_url</tt> uses to save the permalink is <tt>url</tt>
      # but this can be changed in the options hash. Available options are:
      #
      # <tt>:url_attribute</tt>:: The name of the attribute to use for storing the generated url string.
      #                           Default is <tt>:url</tt>
      # <tt>:scope</tt>:: The name of model attribute to scope unique urls to. There is no default here.
      # <tt>:only_when_blank</tt>:: If true, the url generation will only happen when <tt>:url_attribute</tt> is
      #                             blank. Default is false (meaning url generation will happen always)
      # <tt>:sync_url</tt>:: If set to true, the url field will be updated when changes are made to the
      #                      attribute it is based on. Default is false.
