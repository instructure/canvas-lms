  Message: Your commit modifies CoffeeScript. You should probably decaffeinate 
    (https://decaffeinate-project.org/repl/) it then make your changes in the JS file instead.
    CoffeeScript is deprecated in canvas and we eventually want to get rid of all of it.
    If you've given that honest thought and your team still feels it makes sense leave this file
    as CoffeeScript for now and you don't want to see this message
    about it anymore, you can add it to the pattern in gems/tatl_tael/config/default.yml
