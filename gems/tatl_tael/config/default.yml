    Your commit includes new ERB files, which has been a no-no in Canvas since 2011. All new UI should be built in React on top of documented APIs.
    Maybe try doing something like this in your controller instead:

        @page_title = t('Your Page Title')
        @body_classes << 'whatever-classes you-want-to-add-to-body'
        js_bundle :your_js_bundle
