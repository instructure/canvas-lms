# this is only for use as part of the API Gateway experiment
# and is not yet a widely supported tool for general canvas development.
#
# If you are trying to develop or debug an experimental API gateway workflow
# you will need to copy this file into a local ./docker-compose/api-gateway.override.yml file.
#
# 1) replace the image values for both service definitions below with the SAME image version.
#
# 2) match keypairs between canvas and the api gateway for signing and encryption (they should be
#    different keypairs, you can just RSA generate new ones).
#    The canvas side of each keypair should be stored in config/inst_access_signature.yml.
#    See config/inst_access_signature.yml.example for example.
#    private signing key for canvas gets matched to INST_ACCESS_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY here.
#    public encryption key for canvas gets matched to INST_ACCESS_PRIVATE_KEY here.
#
# 3) use dynamic settings to configure your api-gateway url.  If you aren't changing
#     any of the virtual hosts you should be able to just uncomment
#     api_gateway_enabled and api_gateway_uri in the private tree in docker-compose/config/dynamic_settings.yml
#     and make sure that change makes it into your config/dynamic_settings.yml file on disk for your running
#     canvas instance
