Contributing
-----------

In order for us to continue to dual-license our Canvas product to best serve all
of our customers, we need you to sign [our contributor agreement](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/wiki/ica.pdf)
before we can accept a pull request from you. Please read our [FAQ](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/wiki/FAQ)
for more information.

To save yourself a considerable headache, please consider doing development against
our master branch, instead of the default stable branch. Our stable branch is
occasionally reforked from master from time to time, so your Git history may get
very confused if you are attempting to contribute changesets against stable.
