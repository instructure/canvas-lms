    # Mount some specific dirs as volumes (not persistent for now, we would have to name them to make them persist)
    # so that you can make changes outside the container and have them reflect inside the container (and vice versa)
    # without needing to rebuild the containter.
    # Note: we don't mount the entire root directory, e.g ".", b/c it's easy for generated things to conflict between
    # builds. E.g. if you run a bundle install outside the container, then .bundle/config will have it's path set and 
    # then inside the container it may be wrong and not match what was built in the Dockerfile. Or if you recompile just
    # a piece of the assets inside the container and then try to rebuild the whole container, you may end up with the piece
    # you rebuilt to try something out in place after the rebuild which you would expect to be a clean state b/c the rebuild
    # inside also changed the files outside and after the rebuild you end up mounting the old thing into the container when
    # you really want a fresh copy.
    # So we only mount the things we want to actively edit outside the container and have them reflected inside for dev
    # purposes. For rarer things that we want to tinker with, do it inside the container, get it right, then copy it 
    # outside and rebuild the container.
    #
    # Summary: IF YOU MAKE A CHANGE to any file not mounted here outside the container, you have to rebuild the container
    # for the container to pick up the change!
