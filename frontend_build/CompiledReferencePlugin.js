// We have a lot of references to "compiled" directories right now,
// but since webpack can load and compile coffeescript on the fly,
// we can just use a coffeescript loader.  The problem, though, is
// that we don't want to have to change the current references everywhere,
// and it's technically possible to have naming conflicts today.
// to bridge the gap, we'll add "app" to the search path for webpack in
// the config, and replace "compiled" references with "coffeescripts" in The
// path, which should both differentiate them from files in the public/javascripts
// directory with the same name, and load them directly rather than needing
// a compile step ahead of time.
