# We have started the process to squash migration files down to speed up
# local development/testing. This migration will run first and check if the
# migrations being squashed have been either fully or not-at-all applied, in
# which case it is safe to proceed, and otherwise throws an error.
#
# To squash more migrations, update the `last_squashed_migration_version` and
# bump the version in the filename of this migration so it runs again.
