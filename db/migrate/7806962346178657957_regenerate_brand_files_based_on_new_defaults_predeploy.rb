# This needs to run any time someone changes either app/stylesheets/brandable_variables.json
# or one of the images it references. There has to be a predeploy AND a postdeploy migration
# to handle case of anyone saving a new theme in theme editor between when we run predeploys
# and the new code is active. There is code in BrandableCSS that makes sure these 2
# migrations get renamed and ran again when they need to.
