/**
 * Sets usage rights for an array of files and folders within the specified context.
 *
 * This function updates the usage rights for a collection of file and folder objects
 * based on the provided context. It constructs a payload with the file and folder IDs
 * and the desired usage rights, then sends a PUT request to the appropriate API endpoint.
 *
 * Note: This function will only successfully update the usage rights of active attachments and folders
 * that are contained within the given context specified by `contextId` and `contextType`.
 * Any ids that belong to files/folders that are not active or not contained within the given context
 * Will be ignored.
 *
 * @param {BasicFileSystemObject[]} filesystemObject - An array of basic file and folder objects to update.
 * @param {UsageRights} usageRights - The usage rights to apply to the file and folder objects.
 * @param {string} contextId - The ID of the context (e.g., course) containing the files and folders.
 * @param {string} contextType - The type of context (e.g., 'Course') which is case-insensitive.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<any>} A promise that resolves with the response data from the API or rejects with an error.
 *
 * @example
 * setUsageRights(
 *   [{ id: 1, type: 'File' }, { id: 2, type: 'Folder' }],
 *   { use_justification: 'fair_use', legal_copyright: 'copyright owner' },
 *   '123',
 *   'Course'
