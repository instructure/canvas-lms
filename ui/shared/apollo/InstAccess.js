  // the access token (JWT) we need for gateway access without needing to
  // put it in local storage or an easy to poke at global variable.
  //  When we substitute the `gatewayAuthenticatedFetch` as the "fetch"
  // option for an Apollo HttpLink, it will add an inst access token
  // to the header (fetching one if necessary), and should refresh
  // the token and retry once if it ever receives a 4xx (which we
  // would expect in the case when an InstAccess token has passed it's
  // expiration window).
