Live Events (experimental)
==============

Live Events allows you to receive a set of real-time events happening in
your Canvas instance. The events are delivered to a queue which you are
then responsible for consuming. Supported events are described below.

Events are delivered in a "best-effort" fashion. In order to not slow
down web requests, events are sent asynchronously from web requests.
That means that there's a window where an event may happen, but the
process responsible for sending the request to the queue is not able to
queue it.

The currently supported queue is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon SQS</a>.

Live Events is currently an invite-only, experimental feature.


### Event Format

#### Event Attributes

Events are delivered with attributes and a body. The attributes are:

| `event_name` | String | The name of the event. | `create_discussion_topic` |
| `event_time` | String.timestamp | The time, in ISO 8601 format. | `2015-03-18T15:15:54Z` |

#### Body (metadata)

The body is a JSON-formatted string with two keys: `metadata` and `data`.
`metadata` will be any or all of the following keys and values, if the
event originated as part of a web request:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `user_id`    | String | The Canvas id of the currently logged in user. |

| `role` | String | The role of the current user in the current context.  |
| `hostname` | String | The hostname of the current request |
| `producer` | String | The name of the producer of an event. Will always be 'canvas' when an event is originating in canvas. |
| `request_id` | String | The identifier for this request. |
| `session_id` | String | The session identifier for this request. Can be used to correlate events in the same session for a user. |

For events originating as part of an asynchronous job, the following
fields may be set:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `job_id` | String | The identifier for the asynchronous job. |
| `job_tag` | String | A string identifying the type of job being performed. |

The `body` object will have key/value pairs with information specific to
each event, as described below.

Note: All Canvas ids are "global" identifiers, returned as strings.
