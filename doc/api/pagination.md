Pagination
==========

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 10 items by default.
You can set a custom per-page amount with the `?per_page` parameter. There is
an unspecified limit to how big you can set `per_page` to, so be sure to always
check for the `Link` header.

To retrieve additional pages, the returned `Link` headers should be used. These
links should be treated as opaque. They will be absolute urls that include all
parameters necessary to retreive the desired next, previous, first, or last
page.  The one exception is that if an access_token parameter is sent for
authentication, it will not be included in the returned links, and must be
re-appended.  

Pagination information is provided in the [Link header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/9707-link-header.html):

    Link: <https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/:id/discussion_topics.json?page=2&per_page=10>; rel="next",
          <https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/:id/discussion_topics.json?page=1&per_page=10>; rel="first",
          <https://<canvas>/api/v1/courses/:id/discussion_topics.json?page=5&per_page=10>; rel="last"

The possible `rel` values are:

* next - link to the next page of results.
* prev - link to the previous page of results.
* first - link to the first page of results.
* last - link to the last page of results.

These will only be included if they are relevant. For example, the first page
of results will not contain a rel="prev" link.  rel="last" may also be excluded
if the total count is too expensive to compute on each request.
