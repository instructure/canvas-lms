SIS Import Format Documentation
===============================

Instructure Canvas can integrate with an institution's Student Information Services (SIS) in
several ways. The simplest way involves providing Canvas with several CSV files describing
users, courses, and enrollments.
These files can be zipped together and uploaded to the Account admin area.

Standard CSV rules apply:

* The first row will be interpreted as a header defining the ordering of your columns. This
header row is mandatory.
* Fields that contain a comma must be surrounded by double-quotes.
* Fields that contain double-quotes must also be surrounded by double-quotes, with the
internal double-quotes doubled. Example: Chevy "The Man" Chase would be included in
the CSV as "Chevy ""The Man"" Chase".

All text should be UTF-8 encoded.

All timestamps are sent and returned in ISO 8601 format.  All timestamps default to UTC time zone
unless specified.

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

Batch Mode
----------

If the option to do a "full batch update" is selected in the UI, then this SIS upload is considered
to be the new canonical set of data, and data from previous SIS imports that isn't present in
this import will be deleted. This can be useful if the source SIS software doesn't have a way
to send delete records as part of the import. This deletion is scoped to a single term, which
must be specified when uploading the SIS import. Use this option with caution, as it can delete
large data sets without any prompting on the individual records. Currently, this affects courses,
sections and enrollments.

This option will only affect data created via previous SIS imports. Manually created courses, for
example, won't be deleted even if they don't appear in the new SIS import.

users.csv
---------

<table class="sis_csv">
<tr>
<th>Field Name</th>
<th>Data Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>user_id</td>
<td>text</td>
<td><b>Required field</b>. A unique identifier used to reference users in the enrollments table.
This identifier must not change for the user, and must be globally unique. In the user interface,
 this is called the SIS ID.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>login_id</td>
<td>text</td>
<td><b>Required field</b>. The name that a user will use to login to Instructure. If you have an
authentication service configured (like LDAP), this will be their username
from the remote system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>password</td>
<td>text</td>
<td><p>If the account is configured to use LDAP or an SSO protocol then
this isn't needed. Otherwise this is the password that will be used to
login to Canvas along with the 'login_id' above.</p>
<p>If the user already has a password (from previous SIS import or
otherwise) it will <em>not</em> be overwritten</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>first_name</td>
<td>text</td>
<td>Given name of the user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>last_name</td>
<td>text</td>
<td>Last name of the user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>full_name</td>
<td>text</td>
<td>Full name of the user. Omit first_name and last_name if this is provided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sortable_name</td>
<td>text</td>
<td>Sortable name of the user. This is normally inferred from the user's name,
but you can customize it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>short_name</td>
<td>text</td>
<td>Display name of the user. This is normally inferred from the user's name,
but you can customize it here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>email</td>
<td>text</td>
<td>The email address of the user. This might be the same as login_id, but should
still be provided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>status</td>
<td>enum</td>
<td><b>Required field</b>. active, deleted</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The user's name (either first_name and last_name, or full_name) should always
be provided. Otherwise, the name will be blanked out.</p>

<p>When a student is 'deleted' all of its enrollments will also be deleted and
they won't be able to log in to the school's account. If you still want the
student to be able to log in but just not participate, leave the student
'active' but set the enrollments to 'completed'.</p>

xlists.csv is optional. The goal of xlists.csv is to provide a way to add cross-listing
information to an existing course and section hierarchy. Section ids are expected to exist
already and already reference other course ids. If a section id is provided in this file,
it will be moved from its existing course id to a new course id, such that if that new course
is removed or the cross-listing is removed, the section will revert to its previous course id.
If xlist_course_id does not reference an existing course, it will be created. If you want to
provide more information about the cross-listed course, please do so in courses.csv.

Sample:

<pre>
xlist_course_id,section_id,status
E411208,1B,active
E411208,2A,active
E411208,2A,active
