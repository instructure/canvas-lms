# Configuring LTI Advantage Tools

<a name="top"></a>

<div class="warning-message">For versions of LTI previous to LTI 1.3, please
    refer to the <a href="file.tools_xml.html">older documentation</a></div>

For a successful launch to occur, LTI Advantage Tools require configuration
on both Canvas and inside the tool:

- [Configuring LTI Advantage Tools](#configuring-lti-advantage-tools)
- [Overview of an LTI Launch](#overview-of-an-lti-launch)
- [Configuring Canvas in the Tool](#configuring-canvas-in-the-tool)
- [Configuring the Tool in Canvas](#configuring-the-tool-in-canvas)
  - [Anatomy of a JSON configuration](#anatomy-of-a-json-configuration)

But first, the importance of each configuration setting can only be understood
with a basic understanding of how an LTI launch occurs.

<a name="launch-overview"></a>
Overview of an LTI Launch
=======================================
The <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/" target="_blank">IMS Security Framework</a> uses an
<a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#openid_connect_launch_flow" target="_blank">Open ID Connect (OIDC)</a> third-party flow. You'll want to read these specifications in detail, but the following is a Canvas-specific summary:

<a name="step-1"></a>
###Step 1: Login Initiation
Canvas <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#step-1-third-party-initiated-login" target="_blank">initiates a login request</a> to the `oidc_initiation_url` that is <a href="#config-in-canvas">configured on the LTI developer key</a>. This requests contains an issuer identifier (`iss`) to recognize Canvas is launching the tool. As the issuer, Instructure-hosted Canvas instances all use the following, regardless of the specific account domain(s) that the tool was launched from:

- https://canvas.instructure.com (Production environment launches)
- https://canvas.beta.instructure.com (Beta environment launches)
- https://canvas.test.instructure.com (Test environment launches)

The request also includes a `login_hint` that is passed in the next step. Last, the request include the `target_link_uri` that has been configured on the Developer key; this is later used by the tool as a recommended final redirect.

<a name="step-2"></a>
###Step 2: Authentication Request
To complete authentication, tools are expected to send back an <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#step-2-authentication-request" target="_blank">authentication request</a> to an "OIDC Authorization end-point". This can be a GET or POST, however, this request needs to be a redirect in the userâ€™s browser and not made server to server as we need to validate the current user's session data. For cloud-hosted Canvas, regardless of the domain used by the client, the endpoint is always:

- `https://canvas.instructure.com/api/lti/authorize_redirect` (if launched from a **production** environment)
- `https://canvas.beta.instructure.com/api/lti/authorize_redirect` (if launched from a **beta** environment)
- `https://canvas.test.instructure.com/api/lti/authorize_redirect` (if launched from a **test** environment)

Among the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#step-2-authentication-request" target="_blank">required variables</a> the request should include:

- a `redirect_uri`, which must match at least one configured on the developer key.
- a `client_id` that matches the developer key. This must be <a href="#config-in-tool">registered in the tool</a> before the launch occurs.
- the same `login_hint` that Canvas sent in Step 1.
- a `state` parameter the tool will use to validate the request in Step 4.

<a name="step-3"></a>
###Step 3: Authentication Response (LTI Launch)
Canvas will use the `client_id` to lookup which developer key to use and then check the `redirect_uri` that was sent in the previous step and ensure that there is a exact-matching `redirect_uri` on the developer key. Canvas then sends its <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#step-3-authentication-response" target="_blank">authentication response</a> to the `redirect_uri` that the tool provided in Step 2. The request will include an `id_token` which is a signed JWT containing the LTI payload (user identifiers, course contextual data, custom data, etc.). Tools must <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#authentication-response-validation" target="_blank">validate the request is actually coming from Canvas</a> using <a href="#config-in-tool" target="_blank">Canvas' public JWKs</a>.

<a name="step-4"></a>
###Step 4: Resource Display
The tool then validates the `state` parameter matches the one sent in Step 2 and redirects the User Agent to the `target_link_uri` that was sent in Step 1 (or some other location of its choice) to <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#step-4-resource-is-displayed" target="_blank">display the final resource</a>. This redirect occurs in an iframe unless the tool is configured otherwise.

<a name="cookie-less"></a>
###Launching without Cookies

Safari blocking cookies inside 3rd-party iframes made it necessary to create a workaround for storing the `state` property between the login and launch requests, to prevent MITM attacks. The (under final review) LTI Platform Storage spec provides a way for tools that are launching in Safari
or another situation where cookies can't get set to still store data across requests in a secure fashion. Tools can send `window.postMessage`s to
Canvas asking it to store and retrieve arbitrary data, which acts as a cookie-like proxy.

The LTI Platform Storage spec includes an [implementation guide](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-cs-oidc/v0p1)
which should function as the primary resource for implementing this, though a brief usage overview is included below:

In Step 2, instead of storing the `state` parameter in a cookie, the tool should store it in Canvas's LTI Platform Storage using the `lti.put_data` postMessage. It's recommended that the key include the value (eg key: "state-1234", value: "1234) to avoid any collisions during multiple launches, and to make recovering the value easy.

In Step 4, instead of comparing the `state` parameter to the stored value in the cookie, the tool should retrieve it using the `lti.get_data` postMessage. Since this comparison has to happen in Javascript instead of on the server, the tool should render _something_, then check these values. If the values don't match, the tool can then log the user out or render an error.

**Note** that Canvas supports most of the spec, including all message types, but does not currently support using the OIDC Auth URI as the target origin. Tools that want to use these postMessages to set and get data for launches or for other uses must currently direct all messages to the parent Canvas window, using the `*` wildcard origin.

Other LTI Platform Storage spec docs:

- [Client-side postMessages](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-cs-pm/v0p1)
- [postMessage Platform Storage](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-pm-s/v0p1)

Support for this API is determined by either:

1. the presence of the `lti_storage_target` as an extra body parameter in both the login (Step 1) and launch (Step 3) requests, or
2. a response postMessage to the `lti.capabilities` postMessage that contains the `lti.get_data` and `lti.put_data` subjects.

**Note** that `lti_storage_target` is currently present in all launches, including from the Canvas mobile apps. Support for this API in the Canvas mobile apps is not yet implemented, and
the requirements for supporting it are currently under review. Tools should confirm using the `lti.capabilities` postMessage if the current launch supports this API. If tools do not get a
response to that or any message in this API, they should assume that this API is not supported and try to set a cookie instead.

Configuring Canvas in the Tool
=======================================
Tools will need to be aware of some Canvas-specific settings in order to accept a launch from Canvas and use the LTI Advantage Services:

- **Canvas Public JWKs**: When the tool receives the authentication response ([Step 3](#step-3)), tools must <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0/#authentication-response-validation" target="_blank">validate that the request is actually coming from Canvas</a>. Canvas' public keys are environment-specific, but not domain-specific (the same key set can be used across all client accounts):

- Production: `https://canvas.instructure.com/api/lti/security/jwks`
- Beta: `https://canvas.beta.instructure.com/api/lti/security/jwks`
- Test: `https://canvas.test.instructure.com/api/lti/security/jwks`

- **Authorization Redirect URL**: The values and use of this are described in [Step 2](#step-2). Since the URL is static, you will want to configure this in your tool.

- **Client ID**: The `client_id` of the Developer Key that's been configured in Canvas. Your tool will need to use this in the authentication response to Canvas ([Step 2](#step-2)) and it is also used during the <a href="" target="_blank">Client Credentials Grant</a> to access <a href="file.oauth.html#accessing-lti-advantage-services" target="_blank">LTI Advantage Services</a>.

- **Deployment ID**: The `deployment_id` can be optionally configured in the tool. A single developer key may have many deployments, so the deployment ID can be used to identify which deployment is being launched. For more, refer to the LTI 1.3 core specification, <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/#lti_deployment_id-login-parameter" target="_blank">section 4.1.2</a>. The `deployment_id` in Canvas is exposed after a tool has been <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-configure-an-external-app-for-an-account-using-a-client/ta-p/202" target="_blank">deployed using the `client_id`</a>.

<a name="config-in-canvas"></a>
Configuring the Tool in Canvas
=======================================
With LTI Advantage, Canvas moved to using Developer Keys to store tool
configuration information. After a developer key is
<a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-configure-an-LTI-key-for-an-account/ta-p/140" target="_blank">created and enabled</a>,
tools can be deployed to
<a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-configure-an-external-app-for-an-account-using-a-client/ta-p/202" target="_blank">accounts/sub-accounts</a>
or <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-configure-an-external-app-for-a-course-using-a-client/ta-p/1071" target="_blank">courses</a>.

Developer Keys allow tools to set the required parameters to complete the
<a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0#openid_connect_launch_flow"
target="_blank">OpenID Connect Launch Flow</a>, leverage
<a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html#accessing-lti-advantage-services"
 target="_blank">LTI Advantage Services</a>, and configure other important settings.

With guidance from the tool developer, developer keys settings can be manually
entered by Account Admins. Tools providers can also supply Account Admins with
a JSON configuration or configuration URL containing the settings the tool
provider has verified to work.

In the manual case, since many of the extensions listed here require
more than a few lines of configuration, there is not currently an
interface for _every_ extension to be manually configured. Instead, we encourage
tool providers to expose a set of URL endpoints that return working
configuration options for their tool services.

If providing a URL configuration endpoint is not an option, you can also
provide your users with raw JSON that they can paste in for configuration.

## Anatomy of a JSON configuration

In this section, an example JSON configuration is shown followed by a table describing the
relevance of each field.

**NOTE**: Certain placement-specific settings may not be described here.
Some examples of JSON configuration snippets and placement-specific settings are
also found in the placements sub-menu in the left-navigation of this documentation.
