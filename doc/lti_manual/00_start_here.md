# The Canvas LTI Manual

**Audience:**
- new developers on the Interoperability team
- other Canvas developers who are interested in LTI
- anyone who is curious about how Canvas supports LTI
- not really customers

**Goal:**
- Provide a code-focused overview of the way that Canvas implements the LTI standard
- Help readers make an informed decision on where in the code to make changes
- Allow readers to discover existing LTI documentation, whether Canvas-specific or not
- Bring new developers up to speed so that they feel comfortable working with LTI
- Provide explanation for design decisions and why things are The Way They Are

- list of placements and the postmessages and variable substitutions that work for each of them - probably also worth making customer facing
- variable expansion and custom fields
- custom params
- Services (implementation specifics)
