You can use this folder to store example snippets of code which you can
link to in the source documentation using the YARD include directive:

`{include:file:examples/my_example.md}`

The examples aren't restricted to code only, they can be any Markdown
or plain text documents.

This folder and its contents will automatically be copied to the output     
documentation HTML directory by the documentation generation scripts.
