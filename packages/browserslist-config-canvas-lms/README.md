# supported-browsers
The list of browsers that should be supported by Canvas LMS and all the products that are part of the Canvas Ecosystem

## Canvas supports the current and first previous major releases of the following browsers:

*   **Chrome**
*   **Firefox** ([Extended Releases](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/) are not supported)
*   **Internet Explorer** 11 (_Windows onlyâ€”_functionally supported; may exhibit slight visual differences from other browsers, but these differences do not restrict product functionality or accessibility)
*   **Edge**  _(Windows only)_
*   **Respondus Lockdown Browser** (supporting the latest [system requirements](https://www.respondus.com/products/lockdown-browser/requirements.shtml))
*   **Safari**  _(Macintosh only_)

Because browsers are constantly releasing new versions, the actual version numbers that  "current and first previous major release" translates to will change over time. [click here to see what that currently means](http://browserl.ist/?q=last+2+chrome+versions%2C+last+2+firefox+versions%2C+last+2+edge+versions%2C+last+2+ios+versions%2C+last+2+opera+versions%2C+last+2+safari+versions%2C+last+2+ChromeAndroid+versions%2C+ie+%3E%3D+11)

If you are using one of the mainstream browsers that updates itself automatically (eg: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge) or [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416)), you should not ever have to worry about this.
