# = Convenience class for testing graphql types.
#
# This class provides a more convenient workflow for writing graphql queries
# and inspecting their results.  Consider the following example:
#
#   user_type = GraphQLTypeTester.new(@student, current_user: @teacher)
#   expect(user_type.resolve("_id")).to eq @student.id.to_s
#
# this is equivalent to constructing the following query by hand:
#
#   res = CanvasSchema.execute(<<~GQL, context: {current_user: @teacher})
#     node(id: "asdfasdf") {
#       ... on User {
#         _id
#       }
#     }
#   GQL
#   expect(res["data"]["node"]["_id"]).to eq @student.id.to_s
#
class GraphQLTypeTester
  # _test_object_ is the backing object for a GraphQL type.  It must implement
  # +GraphQL::Types::Relay::Node+ (otherwise you'll need to reach down the
  # graph from a parent object).
  #
  # _context_ is an optional default context that will be passed to the query.
  def initialize(test_object, context = {})
    @obj = test_object
    @context = context
    @extract_result = true
  end

  attr_accessor :extract_result
  # _extract_result_ is an boolean to call extract_result function or return raw result.


  # returns the value (or list of values) for the resolved field.  This can be
  # any fragment of graphql, but ultimately should only select a single scalar
  # field:
  #
  # [good]  * <tt>id</tt>
  #         * <tt>foo(bar: BAZ)</tt>
  #         * <tt>userConnection { edges { node { name } } }</tt> In this case,
  #           the return value of resolve will be a list of names
  #         * <tt>course { updatedAt }</tt>
  # [bad]   * <tt>id, name</tt> selecting multiple fields is not allowed
  #         * <tt>userConnection</tt> must select scalars (not compound types)
  #
  # _context_ represents additional context to pass to the query (or to
  # override the context supplied in the constructor).  This will typically be
  # used to pass the _current_user_.
