    "All students must add terms to this glossary. This assignment is worth 20 points. See the Assignments handout for the specific requirements. This is NOT an exercise in copy/paste. Select the terms you add carefully. We will be doing something quite interesting with them. If you think a term might not be up to whatever is ahead, delete it. You all have editing privileges.
