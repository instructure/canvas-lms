# This file is used in Typescript tests and Ruby specs (grep codebase for this
# file) to ensure LTI scopes used in the frontend and backend are in sync, and
# that the documentation lists (only) public scopes. When adding a scope, you
# will need to add it to this file. The tests (and TS type checking) will
# ensure it is added to the correct places in TS, Ruby, and the docs (if
# applicable)
