  # We test this by adding users for every possible combination:
  # Mapping of change type (m, o) and enrollment state (X=none, M, O) to actions to take:
  # 1. m-X    remove member
  # 2. m-M    add member
  # 3. m-O    ??? do nothing (add member would also be fine but seems unnecessary)
  #   this happens when either:
  #     was MO and M was removed
  #     was O, M added and removed
  #     was M, M removed, O added but not seen yet
  #     was X, M added and removed, O added but not seen yet
  # 4. m-MO   add member
  # 5. o-X    remove member, remove owner
  # 6. o-M    remove owner, add member (future remove-remove-add DANCE)
  # 7. o-O    add member, add owner
  # 8. o-MO   add member, add owner
  # 9. mo-X   remove member, remove owner
  # 10. mo-M  remove owner, add member (future remove-remove-add DANCE)
