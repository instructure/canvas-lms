 * You might be seeing something like this in your test:
 * ERROR LOG: 'Unexpected fetch with path "/some/url". â€¦'
 *
 * This means that you have not mocked one or more `fetch()` calls occurring
 * during the lifecycle of a test. You need to mock this request like so:
 *
 * sandbox.fetch.mock('path:/some/url', 200)
 *
 * Other mocking forms are available. For more documentation on fetch-mock, the
