# Custom Matchers
RSpec provides a lot of helpful matchers. Unfortunately, they're not always exactly what you need.

Define your own custom matcher here and Canvas will automatically configure it to be available.

Ex: `expect(foo).to my_custom_matcher(bar)`

Check out the [official docs](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs) for more info.
