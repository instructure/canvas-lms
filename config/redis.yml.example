# # Canvas currently works without Redis, however some features require Redis and will be disabled.
# # Redis can also be used as a replacement for memcache, for both session store and caching.
#
# # The recommended setup is to define your redis server(s) in this file, and
# # then in cache_store.yml specify cache_store: redis_store without any servers
# # listed, which will tell Canvas to use this same server list.
#
# production:
#   servers:
#   # list of redis servers to use in the ring
#   - redis://redis01
#   - redis://redis02

# test:
#   # only tests that are exercising the integration with redis require redis to run.
#   servers:
#   - redis://localhost
#   # warning: the redis database will get cleared before each test, so if you
#   # use this server for anything else, make sure to set aside a database id for
#   # these tests to use.
#   database: 1
