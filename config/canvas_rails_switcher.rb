# that need to be set before rails initialization even starts.

# You can set the Rails version to use by:
# 1. CANVAS_RAILS="<supported version>"
# 2. Create a file RAILS_VERSION with <supported version> as the contents
# 3. Create a Consul setting private/canvas/rails_version with <supported version> as the contents

# the default version (corresponding to the bare Gemfile.lock) must be listed first
