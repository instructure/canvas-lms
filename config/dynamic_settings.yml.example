# this config file is useful if you don't want to run a consul
# cluster with canvas.  Just provide the config data you would
# like for the DynamicSettings class to find, and it will use
# it whenever a call for consul data is issued. Data should be
# shaped like the example below, one key for the related set of data,
# and a hash of key/value pairs (no nesting)
