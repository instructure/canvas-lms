# this config file is useful if you don't want to run vault
# agents with canvas.  Local Development is the most common case
# for this, but a small OSS deployment might have it make sense too.
# Just provide the results data you want the Vault class to "read",
# and it will return it when a call for vault data is issued. Data should be
# shaped like the example below.  Each environment can get a hash,
# there's a key for each read path, and a hash for the returned data
