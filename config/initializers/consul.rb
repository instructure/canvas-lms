# Looking for the DynamicSettings initializer?
# It used to be here, but we actually need our consul
# initialization to happen early enough that other
# initializing things can read their consul settings,
# so all of the "setup" stuff for reading from consul is
# in lib/canvas/dynamic_settings.rb and it gets invoked
# from application.rb as the "canvas.init_dynamic_settings"
# initializer.
