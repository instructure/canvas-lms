# This initializer registers the two interal tools canvas uses
# for tracking errors.  One (:error_report) creates a record in the
# error_reports database table for each exception that occurs.  The
# other (:error_stats) will send two counter increments to statsd,
# one for "all" which tabulates every error that occurs, and one
# that includes the class of the exception in the key so you
# can see big spikes in a certain kind of error.  Either can be
# disabled individually with a setting.
