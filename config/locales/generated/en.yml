      gpa_scale_input_explainer: Scores are input on the 4.0 scale. For instance, if an assignment is out of 100 points, inputting 4.0 results in 100%, 3.0 results in 87%, etc.
      gpa_scale_percentage_explainer: You cannot input points directly, but can input percentages. For instance, if an assignment is out of 50 points, inputting "40" will not work, but "80%" will.
      gpa_scale_scores_explainer: The only scores allowed are predefined in the grading scheme.
      gpa_scale_letters_explainer: Letter grades can be used in addition to number grades.
      gpa_scale_recommendation: Unless your school uses a 4.0 scale (or 5.0/6.0) for grading, Canvas recommends displaying grades as Letter Grade.

      pages:
        body1: Sections have multiple pages. You can see the list of pages for the current section on the right side of the window (%{showme1}). To organize or add pages, click the "%{manage_pages}" link (%{showme2}).
        body2: You can rename any page by click on the %{edit_icon} icon that appears, delete a page by clicking the %{delete_icon} icon, or rearrange the order of pages by click and dragging them.

          ePortfolios are a place where you can display and discuss the significant
          submissions and experiences that are happening during your learning
          process. You can use an ePortfolio to:

          * Display the papers you're proud of for more than just your instructor to see
          * Talk about all the thought and work that went into your class submissions
          * Gather an overview of your educational experience as a whole
          * Share your work with friends, future employers, etc.

          ePortfolios can be public for everyone to see, or private so only those you
          allow can see, and you can change that setting at any time.

      group_explanation: Groups are a good place to collaborate on projects or to figure out schedules for study sessions and the like. Every group gets a calendar, a wiki, discussions, and a little bit of space to store files. Groups can collaborate on documents, or even schedule web conferences. It's really like a mini-course where you can work with a smaller number of students on a more focused project.

Groups you organize yourself can't be used for grading... you can still form your own groups, but you won't be able to turn in an electric copy of any assignments unless your teacher builds the groups for you.

      self_signup_help:
        self_signup_description: You can create sets of groups where students can sign up on their own. Students are still limited to being in only one group in the set, but this way students can organize themselves into groups instead of needing the teacher to do the work. Note that as long as this option is enabled, students can move themselves from one group to another.

        course_group_explanation: Student groups are a useful way to organize students for things like group projects or papers. Every student group gets their own calendar, discussion board and collaboration tools so they can organize themselves and work together more effectively.
        group_assignment_instructions: You can randomly assign students to groups of a specific size, or manually create and organize the groups. Once your groups are created, you can set assignments to be "group submission" assignments, which means each group will have one submission for all users of that group.
        account_group_explanation: Account-level student groups are a good way to group students without being tied to a specific course. Every student group gets their own calendar, discussion board and collaboration tools so they can organize themselves and work together more effectively.

            Multi-factor authentication increases security by requiring that you have something in your physical possession,
            in addition to knowing your password, in order to log in to Canvas. This can be a device that can generate
            verification codes, or a phone that can receive text messages. The Google Authenticator app for [iPhone](%{iphone_url}) or
            [Android](%{android_url}) can be configured by scanning the QR Code below. Other tokens can be configured by entering the
            secret key **%{secret_key}**. Once you have configured multi-factor authentication, it is recommended that you go to your
            profile page and print out a set of back-up codes, in case your normal multi-factor device is unavailable.

      description: |-
        This plugin allows final grades to be published back to a student information system (SIS).  When enabled, the user will be given an option in the gradebook to publish these grades.  This will occur via a POST request to the specified publish endpoint.  Each type defines it's own content format and mime type.  The response from the endpoint does not matter and is currently ignored.

        For example, the Instructure formatted CSV will POST a csv file with mime type 'text/csv' to the specified endpoint, containing the following columns:

        "publisher_id", "publisher_sis_id", "course_id", "course_sis_id", "section_id", "section_sis_id", "student_id", "student_sis_id", "enrollment_id", "enrollment_status", "score", "grade"

        (Note: the "grade" column is only returned if the course specifies a grading standard)

        For each student in the course being published, there will be 1 or more rows in the published csv. Specifically, there will be 1 row for each login that the student has in the course's root account.  Most of the time this will result in 1 row per student, but if the student has multiple logins, there will be a row for each of them.

        If "Include final grade overrides" is checked, and the feature for Final Grade Override is enabled, students with an override grade/score will receive that in place of the calculated score and grade.

        equation_intro: 'Calculated questions are based on a set of one or more formulas computed in order. You can define intermediate variables in these formulas, but the numerical result of the last formula is what is used to generate the correct answer. For example: %{example} For this set of formulas, the final answer is 71. However, there are no predefined variables, so all students would have the same question with the same answer. See the "variables" tab for more information on variables.'
        equation_variables2: 'You can also define variables in your question text using brackets ("What is [a] + [b]?"). For every variable, you''ll see an "Example Value" based on the variable settings. This allows you to check your math and make sure the formulas work. For example, if your question was "What is [a] + 5?" then you''d be asked to define the variable "a". If the example value for "a" were 5.2, you could write: %{example} With this formula you can generate any number of solution sets, with a different value of "a" in each set. One student might see the question, "What is 5.2 + 5?" and another might see "What is 9 + 5?".'
        equation_functions: 'In addition to variables, there are also a collection of helper functions you can use to generate useful values. For example: %{example} To see an explanation of a given helper function, select it from the list below:'

      scheduler_explanation_teacher_paragraph_1: This is the Scheduler Tool. You can use it to create appointment groups for your students to sign up for.
      scheduler_explanation_teacher_paragraph_2: For example, lets say you want to go over the midterm paper assignment with each of the students in your course. You would create a new appointment group, specify the dates and times that you're available, tell it to split that time into 15 minute blocks and only allow one student per time-block.
      scheduler_explanation_teacher_paragraph_3: Then students would get notified and see that they need to sign up for one of the specified time blocks. They will be shown a calendar with the available time blocks overlaid on top of everything on their other calendars so they can pick a time that works for them.
