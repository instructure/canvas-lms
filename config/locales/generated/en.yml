          Google Docs Previews allow users to view documents from
          within Canvas, rather than having to download them and
          open the corresponding program (e.g. Word or Excel).
          
          If Scribd has been enabled on this account, Canvas will
          try to use it to show the preview. If the document

          have the Flash player installed (e.g. iPad/iPhone),

        etherpad: |-
            EtherPad is an open source project that lets you quickly set up shared documents.  It's fast enough that you can see what others are typing as they're typing it. On the other hand, "pads" aren't protected by a password so anyone with a link to them can edit them. EtherPad is better suited than Google Docs if you want to support anonymity and/or allowing people without Google accounts to participate.  
              
            **Warning**: be sure you are familiar with [EtherPad's deletion policy](%{etherpad_deletion_policy_url}) to ensure your work is preserved.
        google_docs: |-
            Google Docs is a great place to collaborate on a group project.  It's like Microsoft Word, but lets you work together with others on the same file at the same time without having to email it around.  
              
            **Warning**: you (and all your collaborators) will need a Google account in order to participate in any Google Docs collaborations.

            Course modules let you organize your assignments, pages, files, etc. into smaller sections or units. Modules could be centered around a theme, focused on a specific topic, or even just grouped chronologically.
            
              You can also sequence modules by defining criteria and prerequisites for each module. Students won't be able to access modules until they have unlocked all their prerequisites. That way you can prevent students from accessing certain content or files until they have, say, gotten at least 75% on a review quiz.
            
              To start organizing your course into modules, click the "%{button}" button to the right.

            ePortfolios are a place where you can display and discuss the significant
            submissions and experiences that are happening during your learning
            process. You can use an ePortfolio to:
            
            * Display the papers you're proud of for more than just your instructor to see
            * Talk about all the thought and work that went into your class submissions
            * Gather an overview of your educational experience as a whole
            * Share your work with friends, future employers, etc.
            
            ePortfolios can be public for everyone to see, or private so only those you
            allow can see, and you can change that setting at any time.

          You can create sets of groups where students can sign up on their own.
          Students are still limited to being in only one group in the set, but this way
          students can organize themselves into groups instead of needing the teacher to
          do the work. You can also require that group members all be part of the same
          course section.
          
          Keep in mind, students can move themselves from one group to another, so when
          your students are done organizing themselves you may want to disable self
          sign-ups.

      Groups are a good place to collaborate on projects or to figure out schedules for study sessions
                      and the like.  Every group gets a calendar, a wiki, discussions, and a little bit of space to store
                      files.  Groups can collaborate on documents, or even schedule web conferences.
                      It's really like a mini-course where you can work with a smaller number of students on a
                      more focused project.

          This plugin allows final grades to be published back to a student information system (SIS).  When enabled, the user will be given an option in the gradebook to publish these grades.  This will occur via a POST request to the specified publish endpoint.  Each type defines it's own content format and mime type.  The response from the endpoint does not matter and is currently ignored.
          
          For example, the Instructure formatted CSV will POST a csv file with mime type 'text/csv' to the specified endpoint, containing the following columns:
          
          "publisher_id", "publisher_sis_id", "course_id", "course_sis_id", "section_id", "section_sis_id", "student_id", "student_sis_id", "enrollment_id", "enrollment_status", "score", "grade"
          
          (Note: the "grade" column is only returned if the course specifies a grading standard)
          
          For each student in the course being published, there will be 1 or more rows in the published csv. Specifically, there will be 1 row for each login that the student has in the course's root account.  Most of the time this will result in 1 row per student, but if the student has multiple logins, there will be a row for each of them.

        equation_intro: "Calculated questions are based on a set of one or more formulas computed in order. You can define intermediate variables in these formulas, but the numerical result of the last formula is what is used to generate the correct answer. For example: %{example} For this set of formulas, the final answer is 71. However, there are no predefined variables, so all students would have the same question with the same answer. See the \"variables\" tab for more information on variables."
        equation_variables2: "You can also define variables in your question text using brackets (\"What is [a] + [b]?\"). For every variable, you'll see an \"Example Value\" based on the variable settings. This allows you to check your math and make sure the formulas work. For example, if your question was \"What is [a] + 5?\" then you'd be asked to define the variable \"a\". If the example value for \"a\" were 5.2, you could write: %{example} With this formula you can generate any number of solution sets, with a different value of \"a\" in each set. One student might see the question, \"What is 5.2 + 5?\" and another might see \"What is 9 + 5?\"."
