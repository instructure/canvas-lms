            EtherPad is an open source project that lets you quickly set up shared documents.  It's fast enough that you can see what others are typing as they're typing it. On the other hand, "pads" aren't protected by a password so anyone with a link to them can edit them. EtherPad is better suited than Google Docs if you want to support anonymity and/or allowing people without Google accounts to participate.  
              
            **Warning**: be sure you are familiar with [EtherPad's deletion policy](%{etherpad_deletion_policy_url}) to ensure your work is preserved.
        google_docs: |-
            Google Docs is a great place to collaborate on a group project.  It's like Microsoft Word, but lets you work together with others on the same file at the same time without having to email it around.  
              
            **Warning**: you (and all your collaborators) will need a Google account in order to participate in any Google Docs collaborations.

            Course modules let you organize your assignments, pages, files, etc. into smaller sections or units. Modules could be centered around a theme, focused on a specific topic, or even just grouped chronologically.
            
            You can also sequence modules by defining criteria and prerequisites for each module. Students won't be able to access modules until they have unlocked all their prerequisites. That way you can prevent students from accessing certain content or files until they have, say, gotten at least 75% on a review quiz.

            Course modules let you organize your assignments, pages, files, etc. into smaller sections or units. Modules could be centered around a theme, focused on a specific topic, or even just grouped chronologically.
            
              You can also sequence modules by defining criteria and prerequisites for each module. Students won't be able to access modules until they have unlocked all their prerequisites. That way you can prevent students from accessing certain content or files until they have, say, gotten at least 75% on a review quiz.
            
              To start organizing your course into modules, click the "%{button}" button to the right.

            ePortfolios are a place where you can display and discuss the significant
            submissions and experiences that are happening during your learning
            process. You can use an ePortfolio to:
            
            * Display the papers you're proud of for more than just your instructor to see
            * Talk about all the thought and work that went into your class submissions
            * Gather an overview of your educational experience as a whole
            * Share your work with friends, future employers, etc.
            
            ePortfolios can be public for everyone to see, or private so only those you
            allow can see, and you can change that setting at any time.

          You can create sets of groups where students can sign up on their own.
          Students are still limited to being in only one group in the set, but this way
          students can organize themselves into groups instead of needing the teacher to
          do the work. You can also require that group members all be part of the same
          course section.
          
          Keep in mind, students can move themselves from one group to another, so when
          your students are done organizing themselves you may want to disable self
          sign-ups.

          Twitter is a service for posting and subscribing to short messages.
          If you have a Twitter account, you can register it here.  Then if you allow
          fellow course/group members to see your registered services, they can 
          easily connect with your Twitter account.
          
          You can also sign up to have notifications sent to your Twitter account.
          These notifications will be sent as direct messages to yourself from
          yourself, and won't appear in your public stream.

You can define intermediate variables in these formulas, but the numerical result of the last formula is what is used to generate the correct answer. For example: %{example} For this set of formulas, the final answer is 71. However, there are no predefined variables, so all students would have the same question with the same answer. See the \"variables\" tab for more information on variables."

For every variable, you'll see an \"Example Value\" based on the variable settings. This allows you to check your math and make sure the formulas work. For example, if your question was \"What is [a] + 5?\" then you'd be asked to define the variable \"a\". If the example value for \"a\" were 5.2, you could write: %{example} With this formula you can generate any number of solution sets, with a different value of \"a\" in each set.
