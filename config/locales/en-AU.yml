            EtherPad is an open source project that lets you quickly set up shared documents.  It's fast enough that you can see what others are typing as they're typing it. On the other hand, "pads" aren't protected by a password so anyone with a link to them can edit them. EtherPad is better suited than Google Docs if you want to support anonymity and/or allowing people without Google accounts to participate.  
              
            **Warning**: be sure you are familiar with [EtherPad's deletion policy](%{etherpad_deletion_policy_url}) to ensure your work is preserved.
        google_docs: |-
            **Warning:** you (and all your collaborators) will need accounts from the supported web tool in order to participate in any collaborations.
                     Free online web tools are an excellent place for students to work on group projects or papers, take shared notes, etc.
                     Teachers or students can set up group collaborations.

          **What do we mean by collaborations?**  We're talking about web-based tools for
                  working together on a shared document.
                  You can use online web tools to work collaboratively on tasks like group papers or note-taking.  This page is
                  an easy place to keep track of those collaborations, and also to set them
                  up without having to swap emails.

            Course modules let you organise your assignments, pages, files, etc. into smaller sections or units. Modules could be centred around a theme, focused on a specific topic, or even just grouped chronologically.
            
            You can also sequence modules by defining criteria and prerequisites for each module. Students won't be able to access modules until they have unlocked all their prerequisites. That way you can prevent students from accessing certain content or files until they have, say, gotten at least 75% on a review quiz.
            
            To start organising your course into modules, click the "%{button}" button to the right.

      Discussions allow students and instructors to communicate about
            course topics at any time. Create discussions for a mark, or facilitate
            discussions for students to exchange ideas and solve problems. Threaded
            discussions are perfect for keeping in-depth or long-term discussions
            organised, while Focused discussions are best suited for short-lived exchanges.

            ePortfolios are a place where you can display and discuss the significant
            submissions and experiences that are happening during your learning
            process. You can use an ePortfolio to: 
            
            * Display the papers you're proud of for more than just your instructor to see
            * Talk about all the thought and work that went into your class submissions
            * Gather an overview of your educational experience as a whole
            * Share your work with friends, future employers, etc.
            
            ePortfolios can be public for everyone to see, or private so only those you
            allow can see, and you can change that setting at any time.

          You can create sets of groups where students can sign up on their own.
          Students are still limited to being in only one group in the set, but this way
          students can organize themselves into groups instead of needing the teacher to
          do the work. You can also require that group members all be part of the same
          course section.
          
          Keep in mind, students can move themselves from one group to another, so when
          your students are done organizing themselves you may want to disable self
          sign-ups.

      Learning outcomes can be included in assignment rubrics as an easy way to assess
      mastery of outcomes aligned to specific assignments.  When you define a learning
      outcome, you should also define a criterion that can be used when building
      assignment rubrics.  Define as many rubric columns as you need and specify a
      point threshold that will be used to define mastery of this outcome.

              Multi-factor authentication increases security by requiring that you have something in your physical possession,
              in addition to knowing your password, in order to log in to Canvas. %{otp_via_sms_message} MFA can be configured by scanning the QR code
              below using a Time-based one-time password (TOTP) authenticator app on iPhone or Android (ex: Google Authenticator,
              Microsoft Authenticator, Authy). Other tokens can be configured by entering the secret key **%{secret_key}**.
              Once you have configured multi-factor authentication, it is recommended that you go to your profile page and print
              out a set of back-up codes, in case your normal multi-factor device is unavailable.

          This plugin allows final marks to be published back to a student information system (SIS).  When enabled, the user will be given an option in the mark book to publish these marks.  This will occur via a POST request to the specified publish endpoint.  Each type defines its own content format and mime type.  The response from the endpoint does not matter and is currently ignored. 
          
          For example, the Instructure formatted CSV will POST a csv file with mime type 'text/csv' to the specified endpoint, containing the following columns: 
          
          "publisher\_id", "publisher\_sis\_id", "course\_id", "course\_sis\_id", "section\_id", "section\_sis\_id", "student\_id", "student\_sis\_id", "enrollment\_id", "enrollment\_status", "score", "grade", "custom\_grade\_status"
          
          (Note: the "grade" column is only returned if the course specifies a grading standard) 
          
          For each student in the course being published, there will be 1 or more rows in the published csv. Specifically, there will be 1 row for each login that the student has in the course's root account.  Most of the time this will result in 1 row per student, but if the student has multiple logins, there will be a row for each of them. 
          
          If "Include final grade overrides" is checked, and the feature for Final Grade Override is enabled, students with an override grade/score will receive that in place of the calculated score and grade.  If the Custom Status Labels feature is enabled, the "custom\_grade\_status" column will contain any custom grade statuses applied to the final grade overrides for that student.

          If the institution does not use WebCT's "Learning Modules" (including schools who adopted WebCT

            as Canvas Modules instead of the "Learning Modules". This page allows one to set the default behaviour of the WebCT migrator
            with respect to content modules. It is important to remember that, while individual course migrations retain the ability

For example, if your question was \"What is [a] + 5?\" then you'd be asked to define the variable \"a\". If the example value for \"a\" were 5.2, you could write: %{example} With this formula you can generate any number of solution sets, with a different value of \"a\" in each set.

      Rubrics can show students your expectations for assignment quality
          and how they'll be scored accordingly. Rubrics can be associated with
          assignments, discussions, and quizzes. Use a rubric solely for marking,
          or create a non-scoring rubric specifically for assessment-based and
          outcome-based marking without points. Outcomes can be added as criteria
          items in rubrics.

      When disabled, new or updated ContextExternalTool installations (including
      LTI 1.3 tools updated automatically due to updates to their developer keys)
      will have their editor_button placement removed if there is no icon_url or
      canvas_icon_class provided in the settings (legacy behaviour). When enabled,
      the placement is not removed, so tools without icons will show a default
      icon (with a colour / letter based on tool name and tool/developer key ID).

      _child_ accounts. This flag does not affect centrally-managed consortia in
      any way.
  when_enabled_for_an_account_sends_data_for_all_lti_77568a4f: |-
      When enabled for an account, sends data for all LTI launches to the PandataEvents system
      for querying and visualisation. Requires Log LTI launches (Site Admin) to also be enabled.
  when_enabled_for_the_parent_account_of_a_non_centr_4d7adbaa: |-
      When enabled for the parent account of a non-centrally managed consortium,
      turning on/off developer keys in the parent will not affect the tool
      installs of the child accounts. When disabled, turning on/off
      SiteAdmin-inherited developer keys in the parent account of a non-centrally
      managed consortium will affect (delete/restore) tools in the children
      accounts (legacy behaviour). This flag applies only to consortium _parent_
      accounts. This flag does not affect centrally-managed consortia in any way.
  when_enabled_global_javascript_and_css_files_can_b_ea21d216: "When enabled, global JavaScript and CSS files can be uploaded in the *%{t_theme_editor}*."

      LTI AGS Score request, to better conform to LTI AGS spec.
  when_enabled_root_accounts_with_a_ready_for_new_qu_b412daa: |-
      When enabled, Root accounts with a `:ready_for_new_quizzes_provision` key
      in their settings that have not been provisioned will be provisioned. This
      check and provision occurs on every shard around that shard region's midnight.

  when_enabled_the_submission_type_selection_placeme_dc9226b2: |-
      When enabled, the submission_type_selection placement will not show up in
      the UI for Dev Keys which do not already have it. Tools can still have the
      placement by editing the JSON, and it will still show up for Dev Keys which
      already have it. This flag is to be removed when after it is completely
      turned on in roughly April-May 2024.

  when_possible_the_lti_tool_finding_logic_will_pref_d34bf1b9: |-
      When possible, the LTI tool finding logic will prefer tools installed from the same
      developer key as the original tool. This prevents the edge case where multiple developer
      keys share the same domain, and a tool from the wrong developer key would be matched first.
  when_posting_grades_for_anonymous_assignments_grad_b13f3ae6: "When posting marks for anonymous assignments, marks will be posted for everyone in the course. Anonymity will be removed."
