            EtherPad is an open source project that lets you quickly set up shared documents.  It's fast enough that you can see what others are typing as they're typing it. On the other hand, "pads" aren't protected by a password so anyone with a link to them can edit them. EtherPad is better suited than Google Docs if you want to support anonymity and/or allowing people without Google accounts to participate.  
              
            **Warning**: be sure you are familiar with [EtherPad's deletion policy](%{etherpad_deletion_policy_url}) to ensure your work is preserved.
        google_docs: |-
            Google Docs is a great place to collaborate on a group project.  It's like Microsoft Word, but lets you work together with others on the same file at the same time without having to email it around.  
              
            **Warning**: you (and all your collaborators) will need a Google account in order to participate in any Google Docs collaborations.

      Discussions allow students and instructors to communicate about
            course topics at any time. Create discussions for a grade, or facilitiate
            discussions for students to exchange ideas and solve problems. Threaded
            discussions are perfect for keeping in-depth or long-term discussions
            organized, while Focused discussions are best suited for short-lived exchanges.

            ePortfolios are a place where you can display and discuss the significant
            submissions and experiences that are happening during your learning
            process. You can use an ePortfolio to: 
            
            * Display the papers you're proud of for more than just your instructor to see
            * Talk about all the thought and work that went into your class submissions
            * Gather an overview of your educational experience as a whole
            * Share your work with friends, future employers, etc.
            
            ePortfolios can be public for everyone to see, or private so only those you
            allow can see, and you can change that setting at any time.

      more focused project.

      Learning outcomes can be included in assignment rubrics as an easy way to assess
      mastery of outcomes aligned to specific assignments.  When you define a learning
      outcome, you should also define a criterion that can be used when building
      assignment rubrics.  Define as many rubric columns as you need, and specify a
      point threshold that will be used to define mastery of this outcome.

              Multi-factor authentication increases security by requiring that you have something in your physical possession,
              in addition to knowing your password, in order to log in to Canvas. This can be a device that can generate
              verification codes, or a phone that can receive text messages. The Google Authenticator app for [iPhone](%{iphone_url}) or
              [Android](%{android_url}) can be configured by scanning the QR Code below. Other tokens can be configured by entering the
              secret key **%{secret_key}**. Once you have configured multi-factor authentication, it is recommended that you go to your
              profile page and print out a set of back-up codes, in case your normal multi-factor device is unavailable.

          This plugin allows final grades to be published back to a student information system (SIS).  When enabled, the user will be given an option in the gradebook to publish these grades.  This will occur via a POST request to the specified publish endpoint.  Each type defines it's own content format and mime type.  The response from the endpoint does not matter and is currently ignored.
          
          For example, the Instructure formatted CSV will POST a csv file with mime type 'text/csv' to the specified endpoint, containing the following columns: 
          
          "publisher_id", "publisher_sis_id", "course_id", "course_sis_id", "section_id", "section_sis_id", "student_id", "student_sis_id", "enrollment_id", "enrollment_status", "score", "grade"
          
          (Note: the "grade" column is only returned if the course specifies a grading standard)
          
          For each student in the course being published, there will be 1 or more rows in the published csv. Specifically, there will be 1 row for each login that the student has in the course's root account.  Most of the time this will result in 1 row per student, but if the student has multiple logins, there will be a row for each of them.
          
          If "Include final grade overrides" is checked, and the feature for Final Grade Override is enabled, students with an override grade/score will receive that in place of the calculated score and grade.

          If the institution does not use WebCT's "Learning Modules" (including schools who adopted WebCT
          prior to version 4.0, when modules were made available), course migrations can be improved by importing the "Course Content"
          as Canvas Modules instead of the "Learning Modules". This page allows one to set the default behavior of the WebCT migrator
          with respect to content modules. It is important to remember that, while individual course migrations retain the ability
          to choose, the bulk migrator always utilizes the value configured here and cannot be changed per migration.

For example, if your question was \"What is [a] + 5?\" then you'd be asked to define the variable \"a\".

      Rubrics can show students your expectations for assignment quality
          and how they'll be scored accordingly. Rubrics can be associated with
          assignments, discussions, and quizzes. Use a rubric solely for grading,
          or create a non-scoring rubric specifically for assessment-based and
          outcome-based grading without points. Outcomes can be added as criteria
          items in rubrics.
