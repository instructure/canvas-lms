  display_name: 'Math: Support LaTex math equations almost everywhere'
  description: |-
    With this feature, LaTex math equations entered into most
    text entry fields in Canvas will be processed by MathJax.
    LaTex delimited by \(...\) become inline equations, while
    $$...$$ will be rendered as a block.  For example,
    you could choose to title an Assignment \(\sqrt{x}\), or
    enter $$ax^2 + by + c = 0$$ in a submission comment.
    This feature requires that the "Math: Updated equation handling"
    flag is also on.
