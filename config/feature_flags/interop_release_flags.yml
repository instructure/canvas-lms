  description: |-
    If enabled, the AGS API will return a more helpful response code whenever an LTI
    tool attempts to access or modify data in a course that has already concluded.
    Rather than returning a generic 404 Not Found, the API will instead return a 422
    along with a helpful message indicating that the tool cannot access concluded
    courses.
