  state: hidden
  display_name: Better LTI AGS Response Codes for Concluded Courses
  description: |-
    If enabled, the AGS API will return a more helpful response code whenever an LTI
    tool attempts to access or modify data in a course that has already concluded.
    Rather than returning a generic 404 Not Found, the API will instead return a 422
    along with a helpful message indicating that the tool cannot access concluded
    courses.

ags_scores_multiple_files:

  display_name: Allow multiple file AGS submissions to count as only one submission
  description: |-
    This feature makes it so that when multiple files are submitted together by
    a third party tool via the Assignments and Grade Service API they will be
    grouped as one submission, rather than creating multiple separate submissions.

allow_lti_tools_editor_button_placement_without_icon:

  description: |-
    When disabled, new or updated ContextExternalTool installations (including
    LTI 1.3 tools updated automatically due to updates to their developer keys)
    will have their editor_button placement removed if there is no icon_url or
    canvas_icon_class provided in the settings (legacy behavior). When enabled,
    the placement is not removed, so tools without icons will show a default
    icon (with a color / letter based on tool name and tool/developer key ID).

    (Forbidden) instead of a 401 code, to be more in line with HTTP standards.
    Also, when the API returns a unauthenticated or unauthorized JSON error,
    the "status" field will not be localized; it will always be given in
    English.

    When enabled for the parent account of a non-centrally managed consortium,
    turning on/off developer keys in the parent will not affect the tool
    installs of the child accounts. When disabled, turning on/off
    SiteAdmin-inherited developer keys in the parent account of a non-centrally
    managed consortium will affect (delete/restore) tools in the children
    accounts (legacy behavior). This flag applies only to consortium _parent_
    accounts. This flag does not affect centrally-managed consortia in any way.
