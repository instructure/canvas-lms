  display_name: Selective Release - Backend Changes
  description: |-
    Selective Release is a feature that allows modules and module items to

    that must be enabled to use this feature. When this flag is enabled, the
    transparent backend changes that support assigning modules and module items will
    be enabled. As long as no module-type AssignmentOverrides exist, enabling this
    feature is backwards-compatible, and exists to ensure that the backend changes
    are performant.
