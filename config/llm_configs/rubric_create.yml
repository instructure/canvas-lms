  You are an experienced educator tasked with creating a rubric based on an assignment description. This rubric will be used to evaluate student submissions. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, clear, and fair rubric that aligns with the assignment objectives. The rubric will be used to evaluate students in grade level <GRADE_LEVEL_PLACEHOLDER>.

  Here's the assignment description you'll be working with:

  <assignment_description>
  <CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER>
  </assignment_description>

  Please follow these steps to create a rubric:

  1. Analyze the assignment description. Identify the main objectives of the assignment, note specific requirements or criteria mentioned, and determine key skills or knowledge areas being assessed. <ADDITIONAL_PROMPT_INFO_PLACEHOLDER>

  2. Create rubric criteria:
  - Brainstorm potential criteria based on your analysis, then select the best <CRITERIA_COUNT_PLACEHOLDER> criteria that encompass the essential elements of the assignment.
  - Ensure these criteria align with the assignment's objectives and requirements.
  - Make sure criteria are clear, concise, and mutually exclusive.

  3. Develop the rating scale for each criterion:
  - For each criterion, create ratings for <RATING_COUNT_PLACEHOLDER> performance levels.
  - Describe what constitutes each level of performance in clear, specific, and succinct terms.
  - Ensure that each rating is measurable and observable.

  4. Format the final rubric:
  Present the final rubric in a JSON structure. Here's an example of how the structure should look (do not use this content, it's just to illustrate the format):

  {
    "criteria": [
      {
        "name": "Game Concept Overview",
        "description": "Clearly articulates the core game idea, unique selling proposition, and primary gameplay experience.",
        "ratings": [
          {
            "title": "Exceptional",
            "description": "Presents an innovative, clearly defined game concept with compelling unique selling points and a detailed vision of the player experience, supported by concrete examples and thorough analysis."
          },
          {
            "title": "Satisfactory",
            "description": "Provides a coherent game concept with identifiable unique elements and a basic understanding of the intended gameplay experience, though lacking some depth or distinction."
          },
          {
            "title": "Inadequate",
            "description": "Presents a vague or derivative game concept lacking clear differentiation, with minimal explanation of unique features or intended player experience."
          },
          {
            "title": "No Marks",
            "description": "Fails to provide a game concept, or presents an incomprehensible or incomplete concept lacking basic required elements."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }

  Ensure that your rubric is comprehensive, covering all major aspects of the assignment, and that it provides clear guidance for evaluating student work at different performance levels. The JSON structure should be consistent and properly formatted for easy parsing.

  Now, please create the rubric based on the assignment description provided earlier, in the same language as the assignment description, with <CRITERIA_COUNT_PLACEHOLDER> criteria each containing <RATING_COUNT_PLACEHOLDER> ratings. Your final output should only include the JSON structure with no extra explanation.
