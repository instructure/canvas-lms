# standard vault config, including address of
# vault server as a string (addr) or in a file (addr_path)
# and path where vault token can
# be found (token_path) or the token itself (token)
# production:
#   addr_path: /path/to/vault/address
#   token_path: /path/to/vault/token
# test:
#   addr: "https://vault.test.domain"
#   token: s.wOrq9dO9kzOcuvB06CMviJhZ
# development:
#   addr: "https://vault.dev.domain"
#   token: s.wOrq9dO9kzOcuvB06CMviJhZ
#
# AWS IAM Authentication (alternative to token-based auth):
# Set these environment variables to enable:
#   VAULT_IAM_AUTH_ENABLED=true           (required to enable IAM auth)
#   VAULT_AWS_AUTH_ROLE=<role>            (required - Vault role name)
#   VAULT_AWS_AUTH_PATH=aws               (optional, default: "aws")
#   VAULT_AWS_AUTH_HEADER_VALUE=vault.example.com  (optional, X-Vault-AWS-IAM-Server-ID)
#
# AWS credentials are sourced from standard AWS SDK chain:
# - Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc.)
# - EC2 instance profile
# - ECS task role
#
# When IAM auth is enabled, the token/token_path configuration is ignored.
#
# Vault Address (environment variable alternative):
#   VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.example.com:8200
#
# This standard HashiCorp environment variable will be used if it is set,
# useful for Kubernetes deployments.

# if you don't want to run vault, you can make use
# of a "vault_contents.yml" file in this directory and
# specify "file" as both your addr and token_path.
# this will make Canvas Vault read from the file
# contents rather than trying to talk to a vault agent.
