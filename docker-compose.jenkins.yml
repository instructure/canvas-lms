# despite building upon the other docker-compose files, in CI land we only
# spin up things explicitly listed here. so to add a new service to CI,
# you need to at least add something here (it can as simple as
# `service_name: {}` if the upstream config is correct)
#
# if you have a service that depends on cached volume data (e.g. pre-
# migrated postgres, assets, etc), ensure it shares a volume with the
# data_loader, and it will automagically get cached/fetched
#
# if you have a service that takes a few moments to spin up (e.g.
# a database server), if you want to ensure it's actually up as
# part of docker-composing, you should implement /wait-for-it
