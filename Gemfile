# What have they done to the Gemfile???
#
# Relax. Breathe deep. All the gems are still there; they're just loaded in
# various files in Gemfile.d/. This allows us to require gems locally that we
# might not want to commit to our public repo. We can maintain a customized
# list of gems for development and debuggery, without affecting our ability to
# merge with canvas-lms
#
# NOTE: some files in Gemfile.d/ will have certain required gems indented.
# While this may seem arbitrary, it actually has semantic significance. An
# indented gem required in Gemfile is a gem that is NOT directly used by
# Canvas, but required by a gem that is used by Canvas. We lock into specific
# versions of these gems to prevent regression, and the indentation serves to
# alert us to the relationship between the gem and canvas-lms

  # 1. All dependencies under a private source must be pinned in the private plugin gemspec
  # 2. All sub-dependencies of (1) must be pinned in plugins.rb
  # 3. All additional public dependencies of private plugins must be pinned in plugins.rb
