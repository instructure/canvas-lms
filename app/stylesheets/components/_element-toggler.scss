@styleguide Element Toggler

<br/>
This represents current best practices around using the `.element-toggler` class.

<br/>

  - The current thinking on accessibility is that we should use a `<span>` for the 
  element-toggler dom element so that it's not read as "link" like it would if we used an &lt;&gt; tag.  
  - Use `aria-controls` and `aria-expanded` on the dom element that has class `element_toggler`.  
  - Also include an aria-label, of the format: `[toggler-name] toggle [toggled-content-description] visibility`.  

<br/>

```html

<span
  class="element_toggler"
  aria-controls="group_1"
  aria-expanded="true"
  aria-label="Toggler toggle list visibility"
  role="button"
>
  <i class="icon-mini-arrow-down"></i> Toggler
</span>
<ul id="group_1">
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
</ul>

```

See `app/coffeescripts/behaviors/elementToggler.coffee`for implementation
