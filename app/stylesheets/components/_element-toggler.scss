@styleguide Element Toggler

This represents current best practices around using the .element-toggler class.

The current thinking on accessibility is that we should use a span for the
element-toggler dom element so that it's not read as "link" like it would if we
used an &lt;&gt; tag.  Use aria-controls and aria-expanded on the dom element that
has class element_toggler.  However, this does not work in all the screenreader
configurations that we currently support, so it is also recommended that you
include an aria-label, of the format: "[toggler-name] toggle
[toggled-content-description] visibility".  So for example on the assignment
index page, for an assignment group named "Math Week 1" we say "Math Week
1 toggle assignment visibility"

see app/coffeescripts/behaviors/elementToggler.coffee for implementation
see the styleguide javascript for a bit of js to toggle the arrow button based
on state.

```html

<span
  class="element_toggler"
  aria-controls="group_1"
  aria-expanded="true"
  aria-label="Toggler toggle list visibility"
  role="button"
>
  <i class="icon-mini-arrow-down"></i> Toggler
</span>
<ul id="group_1">
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
</ul>

```

.element_toggler {
  cursor: pointer;
}
