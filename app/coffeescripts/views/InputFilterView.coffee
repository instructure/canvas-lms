  ##
  # Makes an input field that emits `input` and `select` events, and
  # automatically selects itself if the user presses the enter key (don't have
  # to backspace out the text, or if you do, it deletes all of it).
  #
  # Events:
  #
  #   input: Emits after a short delay so it doesn't fire off the event with
  #   every keyup from the user, sends the value of the input in the event
  #   parameters.
  #
  #   enter: Emits when the user hits enter in the field
