    # The naive approach to dropping the lowest grades (calculate the
    # grades for each combination of assignments and choose the set which
    # results in the best overall score) is obviously too slow.

    # This approach is based on the algorithm described in "Dropping Lowest
    # Grades" by Daniel Kane and Jonathan Kane.  Please see that paper for
    # a full explanation of the math.
