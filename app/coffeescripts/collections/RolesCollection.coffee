    # Method Summary
    #   Roles are ordered by base_role_type then alphabetically within those
    #   base role types. The order that these base role types live is defined
    #   by the sortOrder array. There is a special case however. AccountAdmin
    #   role always goes first. This uses the index of the sortOrder to ensure
    #   the correct order since comparator is just using _.sort in it's 
    #   underlining implementation which is just ordering based on alphabetical
    #   correctness.
