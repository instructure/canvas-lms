    # Overridden to allow recognition of hybrid jsonapi.org/canvas-style
    # compound documents.
    #
    # These compound documents side load related objects as secondary
    # collections alongside the primary collection, rather than embedded within
    # the primary collection's objects. But unlike jsonapi.org, foreign keys
    # relating the primary and secondary objects are left as properties on the
    # primary object, rather than being encapsulated in a `links' property.
    # Canvas indicates which collection in the response is primary through the
    # `meta' property's `primaryCollection' subproperty.
    #
    # To adapt this style to Backbone, we check for this property and, if
    # found, we extract the primary collection and pre-process any declared
    # side loads into the embedded format that Backbone expects.
    #
    # Declaring recognized side loads is done through the `sideLoad' property
    # on the collection class. The value of this property is an object whose
    # keys identify the target relation property on the primary objects. The
    # values for those keys can either be `true', a string, or an object.
    #
    # If the value is an object, the foreign key and side loaded collection
    # name are identified by the `foreignKey' and `collection' properties,
    # respectively. Absent properties are inferred from the relation name.
    #
    # A value is `true' is treated the same as an empty object (side load
    # defined, but properties to be inferred). A string value is treated as a
    # hash with a collection name, leaving the foreign key to be inferred.
    #
    # For examples, the following are all identical:
    #
    #   sideLoad:
    #     author: true
    #
    #   sideLoad:
    #     author:
    #       collection: 'authors'
    #
    #   sideLoad:
    #     author:
    #       foreignKey: 'author_id'
    #       collection: 'authors'
    #
    # If the authors are instead contained in the `people' collection, the
    # following can be used interchangeably:
    #
    #   sideLoad:
    #     author:
    #       collection: 'people'
    #
    #   sideLoad:
    #     author:
    #       foreignKey: 'author_id'
    #       collection: 'people'
    #
    # Alternately, if the collection is `authors' and the target relation
    # property is `author', but the foreign key is `person_id' (such a silly
    # API), you can use:
    #
    #   sideLoad:
    #     author:
    #       foreignKey: 'person_id'
    #
