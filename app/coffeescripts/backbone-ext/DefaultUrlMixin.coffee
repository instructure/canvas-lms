  # In the spirit of convention over configuration, if the base API route of
  # your model follows canvas's default routing pattern of:
  # /api/v1/<context_type>/<context_id>/<plural_form_of_resource_name> then
  # you can just define a `resourceName` property on your model or collection
  # and fall back on this default 'url' function.  This will look for a
  # @contextCode on your collection and fall back to
  # ENV.context_asset_string.
  #
  # So, for example say you are on /courses/1 and you do new
  # DiscussionTopicsCollection().fetch() it will go to
  # /api/v1/courses/1/discussion_topics (since ENV.context_asset_string will
  # be already set)
