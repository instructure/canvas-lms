module Canvas
  # Canvas extensions to the base AMS. All instances of this class require a
  # Controller instance to operate.
  #
  # Serializers inherting from this class will be equipped with several helper
  # methods as well as runtime options.
  #
  # Methods available on your instance:
  #
  # @method session
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Base] The controller's session.
  #
  # @method controller
  # @return [ApplicationController]
  #   The controller instance the serializer is bound to.
  #
  # @method accepts_jsonapi?
  # @return [Boolean] Whether jsonapi header is present.
  #
  # @method polymorphic_url
  # @return [String] good ole' rails URL helpers
  #
  # @method context
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Base|NilClass]
  #   If your controller has a @context, it'll be that. Otherwise, nil.
  #
  # @method stringify_json_ids?
  # @return [Boolean]
  #   Whether the stringify_json_ids? header is present.
  #
  # @method user
  # @alias  current_user
  # @return [ActiveRecord::Base|Hash|NilClass]
  #   Whatever you pass in as options[:scope] to the serializer initializer.

    # Array of strings that can be passed by the controller to signal which
    # associations to embed in the serializer output. You can test this array

    #
