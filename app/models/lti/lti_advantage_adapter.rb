require 'lti_advantage'

module Lti

  # Responsible for generating parameters for both Login requests
  # and Authentication Responses (ID token).
  #
  # This class serves a similar purpose to LtiOutboundAdapter
  # (and exposes the same interface), but is only
  # used for LTI 1.3. LtiOutboundAdapter is used only for LTI 1.x.
  #
  # Please refer to the following IMS specification sections:
  # - https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0#step-1-third-party-initiated-login
  # - http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/#additional-login-parameters
  #
  # LtiAdvantageAdapter offers various methods that provide
  # context-tailored parameters for login requests and authentication
  # responses:
  #   - generate_post_payload_for_assignment
  #   - generate_post_payload_for_homework_submission
  #   - generate_post_payload
  #
  # These are the primary methods used to interface with
  # LtiAdvantageAdapter from external classes. A brief
  # overview of each can be found in method-specific
  # documentation.
  #
  # In general, the formation of the login request (and later
  # authentication response) is handled in the following way:
  #
  # 1. Generate the complete, signed id_token that will be sent
  #    in the authentication response from Canvas to the tool.
  # 2. Create a random cache key, and store the id_token in
  #    cache for later retrieval if authentication with the
  #    the tool succeeds.
  # 3. Include the cache key as the "lti_message_hint" parameter
  #    in the login request. This value is passed back to Canvas
  #    By the tool in the authentication request (handled by
  #    app/controllers/lti/ims/authentication_controller.rb#authorize).
  #
  # For information on how the cached ID token is eventually retrieved
  # and sent to a tool, please refer to the inline documentation of
  # app/controllers/lti/ims/authentication_controller.rb

    # Generates a login request pointing to a general-use
    # cached launch (ID token).
    #
    # This method, along with all other "generate_post_payload_for_*"
    # methods, generates a login request in the following way:
    #
    # 1. Determine what the message type should be. For now this
    #    is always either "LtiResourceLinkRequest" or "DeepLinkingRequest".
    #    Default to "LtiResourceLink" if the requested message type is
    #    not recognized.
    # 2. Invoke the constructor for the "factory" class that builds
    #    the requested message type. At the time of writting, these
    #    classes live in "lib/lti/messages".
    # 3. Cache the ID token returned from the factory class (this is a
    #    signed JWT, so always a string)
    # 4. Construct the login request parameters with a lti_message_hint
    #    that points to the cached ID token.
    #
    # Please refer to the following IMS specification sections:
    # - https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0#step-1-third-party-initiated-login
