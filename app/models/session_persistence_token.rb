# A SessionPersistenceToken is a one-time-use "remember me" token to maintain a
# user's login across browser sessions. It has an expiry, and it's destroyed
# when the user logs out, but most importantly, it is destroyed after the first
# time it is used to authenticate the user.
#
# The token is comprised of three fields:
# <token_id:pseudonym.persistence_token:random_uuid>
#
# The first field allows efficient lookup, the second field verifies that the
# pseudonym hasn't changed their password or anything else that changes the
# persistence_token, and the last field is an unguessable token identifier
# generated at random. This last field is password-equivalent, so it's stored
# as a salt+hash server-side.
#
# much of the theory here is based on this blog post:
# http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/01/19/persistent_login_cookie_best_practice/
#
# See the PseudonymSession model for the *_cookie methods that use this class.
