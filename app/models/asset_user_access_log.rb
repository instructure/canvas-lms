class AssetUserAccessLog
  # this class is a companion to AssetUserAccess, and is used
  # to relieve write throughput pressure for little changes
  # like bumps to view counts.  The general design is to make
  # many small inserts and compact them into real updates later.
  #
  # aua_logs_0 and other tables (up to aua_logs_6) hold the
  # inserted data for little updates like this for each day of the
  # week (0 == sunday, 6 == saturday).  This lets us truncate
  # a day of processed values rather than deleting a bunch of rows,
  # easier on I/O throughput. (see the AuaLog[INDEX] models below)
  #
  # Managed by a PluginSetting for "asset_user_access_logs",
  # it should default mostly to the "update" write_path which
  # does not use this log-and-compact model.  To make a given
  # setting level use this model, you'd have to set:
  #
  # ps = PluginSetting.find_or_initialize_by(name: "asset_user_access_logs")
  # ps.inheritance_scope = "shard"
  # ps.settings = { max_log_ids: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], write_path: 'log' }
  # ps.save!
  #
  # and confirm that your settings look right in a new process:
  # PluginSetting.cached_plugin_setting("asset_user_access_logs")

  # Yeah, the multiple models thing below
  # feels a little silly, but we do want to take
  # advantage of all of AR's sql writing helpers,
  # resetting the table name on a single model seems
  # possibly dangerous depending on where that's cached
  # throughout the rails stack, and they should
  # only get used internally to the AssetUserAccessLog
  # class.
