# @class Quizzes::QuizSubmission::QuestionReferenceDataFixer
#
# This "fixup" class deals with quiz submissions that are pointing incorrectly
# to non-QuizQuestion objects in their question data, which happens when
# questions are pulled out of a question bank.
#
# Normally, we'd generate a QuizQuestion for every question presentable in the
# quiz, however, in this case the submission's question records (in `quiz_data`
# and `submission_data`) point to the original AssessmentQuestion objects.
# This results in ambiguous id fields that could point either to QuizQuestion or
# AssessmentQuestion objects.
#
# ## Usage
#
# The fixer is expected to be called prior to any usage of the submission's
# quiz_data or submission_data fields. It will go through those records,
# identify such cases, then create a QuizQuestion object with a workflow_state
# of :generated that mimics the source AssessmentQuestion. Afterwards, the
# "id" field in the question records are updated to point to the newly created
# question object(s).
class Quizzes::QuizSubmission::QuestionReferenceDataFixer

  # This method is re-entrant. If QuizSubmission#question_references_fixed is
  # true, the fix won't be re-applied.
  #
  # @return [Boolean|NilClass]
  #   - `nil` if the fix was previously applied, or the submission is not
  #     applicable.
  #   - `true` if the submission needed fixing.
  #   - `false` otherwise.
