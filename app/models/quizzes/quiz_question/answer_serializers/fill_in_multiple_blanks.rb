module Quizzes::QuizQuestion::AnswerSerializers

  # @internal
  # :nodoc:
  #
  # A note on "blanks" to help clear the confusion around their uses, especially
  # in the context of this serializer:
  #
  # There are three distinct versions of an answer's blank used at various
  # stages:
  #
  # 1. the "blank", which is a simple string defined by the teacher when they
  #    created the quiz question, and this is what the API clients are expected
  #    to use for sending answers to that blank
  #
  # 2. the "blank_id": which is a normalized version of the "blank", used
  #    internally to identify the blank (it's a digest), see Util#blank_id
  #    and AssessmentQuestion#variable_id for generating this version
  #
  # 3. the "blank key", which is the key to store the _answer_ to that blank in
  #    a quiz submission's submission_data construct, nobody has to know about
  #    this except for the parsers/serializers
  #
  # Unfortunately, the question_data records refer to the vanilla "blank" as
  # "blank_id", so if you do something like:
  #
  #     qq = quiz.quiz_questions.first # say this is a FIMB question
  #     qq.question_data[:answers][0]
  #
  # You will get a construct with:
  #
  #     { "id"=>"9711", "text"=>"Red", "weight"=>100, "blank_id"=>"color" }
  #
  # Which gave me motive to write this note to help clear up the confusion.
