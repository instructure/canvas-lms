# Outstanding Quiz Submissions Manager
#
# API for accessing quiz submissions which we term "outstanding" in that they are
# unsubmitted, started, and overdue.
#
# These submissions can be found by #find_by_quiz, at the
# API level, and graded internally by #grade_by_course
# or at the API by #grade_by_ids
