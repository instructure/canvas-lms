  # this is because on the servers we are actually using graphics_magic not image_magic's mogrify and graphics_magick doesn't
  # support -strip. you'd get something like:
  # MiniMagick::Error (Command ("mogrify -strip -resize \"200x50\" \"/tmp/mini_magick23816-1\"") failed: {:status_code=>1, :output=>"mogrify: Unrecognized option (-strip).\n"}):#012
