# MicrosoftSync contains models used to sync course enrollments to Microsoft
# Teams via Microsoft's APIs. For customers using their new (in development as
# of 2021) Teams tool, Microsoft needs up-to-date Canvas course enrollment
# details.
#
# This model is the main model, and is created when a teacher turns on (in
# course settings) the option to sync enrollments to Microsoft Teams. It is
# then used to keep track of the syncing.
#
# See usages in StateMachineJob (workflow_state, job_state, last_error) and
# SyncerSteps (ms_group_id)
#
# Notable fields:
# * ms_group_id -- Microsoft's ID used in the their Graph API for the group
#
