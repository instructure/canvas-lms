#
# See MicrosoftSync::Group for more info on Microsoft sync. This model is
# essentially a cache between a Canvas user, and their Microsoft AAD object ID
# (internal Microsoft user ID, also called just an "AAD" in this code) which is
# used in all of Microsoft's APIs, so we don't have to look it up every time we
# use Microsoft's APIs.
#
# Typically, a user's AAD is looked up by asking Microsoft for the AAD for a given
# UserPrincipalName (UPN) or other field on the Microsoft side that corresponds
# to a Canvas user's email address, username, or other field. The fields on the
# Canvas side and Microsoft side to match on are configurable in the root account
# settings (see microsoft_sync_login_attribute setting and other
# microsoft_sync_* settings). The value passed to the Microsoft API to match on
# such as the Canvas user's email address is referred to throughout MicrosoftSync
# as a "ULUV" or User Lookup Value.
