# What is a past lti id and why do we have it.
# when a user_a is merged into user_b, user_a is deleted, and user_b remains
# active. Now any courses, groups, or accounts
# that user_a was in at the time of the merge will get a past_lti_id.
#
# => UserPastLtiId(id: integer, user_id: integer, context_id: integer, context_type: string,
#    user_uuid: string, user_lti_id: text, user_lti_context_id: string)
#
# On the past_lti_id we store uuid, lti_id, lti_context_id for a user in a context.
#
# Anytime user_b launches an lti_tool from a context that user_a was a member of,
# they will get the past_lti_ids for user_a even if both user_a and user_b were
# members of that context. In that case we wouldn't know that user_b was there
# prior and we always serve a past_lti_id if there is one present.
#
# This is happening because when a user is merged lti_tools may break or stop
# working because they were using one of those ids as the unique identifier for
# the lti_launch and it could break the lti_tool for the user.
#
# All past_lti_ids are stored on the same shard as the context so that a user
# can always be looked up from the context's shard.
