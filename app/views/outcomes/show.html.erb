      There are a few old LearningOutcomeResults that have a nil artifact, and
      many that have a Submission as an artifact.  We want to get rid of these
      because they come from bad data, and step 1 toward that goal is to stop
      creating them and hide them in the UI.

      The LORs with a nil artifact are very old and I believe came from a very
      early incarnation of outcomes.  The LORs with a Submission as an artifact
      came from a combination of two code problems.  The first was old code
      that allowed an assignment that was aligned with an outcome but did not
      have a rubric to create LORs directly based on it's submission.  The
      second was a bug that prevented the assignment <-> outcome link from
      being destroyed when a rubric with an outcome was removed from an
      assignment.
