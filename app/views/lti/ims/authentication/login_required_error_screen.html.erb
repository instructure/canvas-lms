        If you're seeing this with a local dev or HTTP version of Canvas, it's likely because
        <a href="https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site/" target="_blank">Chrome blocks Same-Site cookies that aren't Secure</a>,
        so the LTI launch process in the iframe can't see the Canvas session cookie.
