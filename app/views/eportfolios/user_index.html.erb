ePortfolios are a place where you can display and discuss the significant
submissions and experiences that are happening during your learning
process. You can use an ePortfolio to:

* Display the papers you're proud of for more than just your instructor to see
* Talk about all the thought and work that went into your class submissions
* Gather an overview of your educational experience as a whole
* Share your work with friends, future employers, etc.

ePortfolios can be public for everyone to see, or private so only those you
allow can see, and you can change that setting at any time.
