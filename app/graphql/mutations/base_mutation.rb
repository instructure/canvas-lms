# = Base Canvas Mutation class
#
# The most fundamental change this class makes compared to
# +GraphQL::Schema::Mutation+ is that it facilitates conveniently following
# the convention of always taking a single input argument and returning a
# unique payload per mutation.
#
# Any arguments defined in a mutation descended from this class will be
# hoisted into a custom input object.  Fields on the mutation will similarly
# be hoisted into a custom payload object.
#
# An +errors+ field will be added to all payloads for validation errors.
class Mutations::BaseMutation < GraphQL::Schema::Mutation
  field :errors, [Types::ValidationErrorType], null: true

  class << self
    # this is copied from GraphQL::Schema::RelayClassicMutation - it moves all
    # the arguments defined with the ruby-graphql DSL into an auto-generated
    # input type
    #
    # this is a bit more convenient that defining the types by hand
    #
    # we could base this class on RelayClassicMutation but then we get the weird
    # {client_mutation_id} fields that we don't care about
