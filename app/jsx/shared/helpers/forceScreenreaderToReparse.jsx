   * Preface: This is a horrible terrible function and should only be used

   *          exist at all.
   *
   * This function will cause a given DOM node to be completely thrown away and
   * re-rendered.  This is helpful to screenreaders because JavaScripty stuff
   * doesn't work so well.  They generally read the page once and call it good.
   *
   *
   * *******PLEASE REMOVE THIS FUNCTION WHENEVER IT CAN BE DONE*******
