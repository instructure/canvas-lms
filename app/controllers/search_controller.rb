  # @API Find recipients
  # Find valid recipients (users, courses and groups) that the current user
  # can send messages to. The /api/v1/search/recipients path is the preferred
  # endpoint, /api/v1/conversations/find_recipients is deprecated.
  #
  # Pagination is supported.
  #
  # @argument search [String]
  #   Search terms used for matching users/courses/groups (e.g. "bob smith"). If
  #   multiple terms are given (separated via whitespace), only results matching
  #   all terms will be returned.
  #
  # @argument context [String]
  #   Limit the search to a particular course/group (e.g. "course_3" or "group_4").
  #
  # @argument exclude[] [String]
  #   Array of ids to exclude from the search. These may be user ids or
  #   course/group ids prefixed with "course_" or "group_" respectively,
  #   e.g. exclude[]=1&exclude[]=2&exclude[]=course_3
  #
  # @argument type [String, "user"|"context"]
  #   Limit the search just to users or contexts (groups/courses).
  #
  # @argument user_id [Integer]
  #   Search for a specific user id. This ignores the other above parameters,
  #   and will never return more than one result.
  #
  # @argument from_conversation_id [Integer]
  #   When searching by user_id, only users that could be normally messaged by
  #   this user will be returned. This parameter allows you to specify a
  #   conversation that will be referenced for a shared context -- if both the
  #   current user and the searched user are in the conversation, the user will
  #   be returned. This is used to start new side conversations.
  #
  # @argument permissions[] [String]
  #   Array of permission strings to be checked for each matched context (e.g.
  #   "send_messages"). This argument determines which permissions may be
  #   returned in the response; it won't prevent contexts from being returned if
  #   they don't grant the permission(s).
  #
  # @example_response
  #   [
  #     {"id": "group_1", "name": "the group", "type": "context", "user_count": 3},
  #     {"id": 2, "name": "greg", "full_name": "greg jones", "common_courses": {}, "common_groups": {"1": ["Member"]}}
  #   ]
  #
  # @response_field id The unique identifier for the user/context. For
  #   groups/courses, the id is prefixed by "group_"/"course_" respectively.
  # @response_field name The name of the context or short name of the user
  # @response_field full_name Only set for users. The full name of the user
  # @response_field avatar_url Avatar image url for the user/context
  # @response_field type ["context"|"course"|"section"|"group"|"user"|null]
  #   Type of recipients to return, defaults to null (all). "context"
  #   encompasses "course", "section" and "group"
  # @response_field types[] Array of recipient types to return (see type
  #   above), e.g. types[]=user&types[]=course
  # @response_field user_count Only set for contexts, indicates number of
  #   messageable users
  # @response_field common_courses Only set for users. Hash of course ids and
  #   enrollment types for each course to show what they share with this user
  # @response_field common_groups Only set for users. Hash of group ids and
  #   enrollment types for each group to show what they share with this user
  # @response_field permissions[] Only set for contexts. Mapping of requested
  #   permissions that the context grants the current user, e.g.
  #   { send_messages: true }
