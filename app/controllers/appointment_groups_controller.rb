# @API Appointment Groups

# API for creating, accessing and updating appointment groups. Appointment groups
# provide a way of creating a bundle of time slots that users can sign up for
# (e.g. "Office Hours" or "Meet with professor about Final Project"). Both time
# slots and reservations of time slots are stored as Calendar Events.
