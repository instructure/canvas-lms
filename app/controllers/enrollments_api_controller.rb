  # Depending on the URL given, return either (1) all of the enrollments in
  # a course, (2) all of the enrollments in a section or (3) all of a user's
  # enrollments. This includes student, teacher, TA, and observer enrollments.
  #
  # If a user has multiple enrollments in a context (e.g. as a teacher
  # and a student or in multiple course sections), each enrollment will be
  # listed separately.
  #
  # note: Currently, only an admin user can return other users' enrollments. A
  # user can, however, return his/her own enrollments.
  #
  # @argument type[] A list of enrollment types to return. Accepted values are 'StudentEnrollment', 'TeacherEnrollment',
  #   'TaEnrollment', 'DesignerEnrollment', and 'ObserverEnrollment.' If omitted, all enrollment types are returned.

  # @argument role[] A list of enrollment roles to return. Accepted values include course-level roles created by the
  #   {api:RoleOverridesController#add_role Add Role API} as well as the base enrollment types accepted by the `type`
  #   argument above.
  # @argument state[] Filter by enrollment state. Accepted values are 'active', 'invited', and 'creation_pending',
  #   'deleted', 'rejected', 'completed', and 'inactive'. If omitted, 'active' and 'invited' enrollments are returned.
