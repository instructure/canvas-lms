  # enrollments. This includes student, teacher, TA, and observer enrollments.
  #
  # If a user has multiple enrollments in a context (e.g. as a teacher
  # and a student or in multiple course sections), each enrollment will be
  # listed separately.
  #
  # note: Currently, only an admin user can return other users' enrollments. A
  # user can, however, return his/her own enrollments.
  #
  # @argument type[] [String]
  #   A list of enrollment types to return. Accepted values are
  #   'StudentEnrollment', 'TeacherEnrollment', 'TaEnrollment',
  #   'DesignerEnrollment', and 'ObserverEnrollment.' If omitted, all enrollment
  #   types are returned. This argument is ignored if `role` is given.
  #
  # @argument role[] [String]
  #   A list of enrollment roles to return. Accepted values include course-level
  #   roles created by the {api:RoleOverridesController#add_role Add Role API}
  #   as well as the base enrollment types accepted by the `type` argument above.
  #
  # @argument state[] [String, "active"|"invited"|"creation_pending"|"deleted"|"rejected"|"completed"|"inactive"]
  #   Filter by enrollment state. If omitted, 'active' and 'invited' enrollments
  #   are returned. When querying a user's enrollments (either via user_id
  #   argument or via user enrollments endpoint), the following additional
  #   synthetic states are supported: "current_and_invited"|"current_and_future"|"current_and_concluded"
  #
  # @argument include[] [String, "avatar_url"|"group_ids"|"locked"|"observed_users"|"can_be_removed"]
  #   Array of additional information to include on the enrollment or user records.
  #   "avatar_url" and "group_ids" will be returned on the user record.
  #
  # @argument user_id [String]
  #   Filter by user_id (only valid for course or section enrollment
  #   queries). If set to the current user's id, this is a way to
  #   determine if the user has any enrollments in the course or section,
  #   independent of whether the user has permission to view other people
  #   on the roster.
  #
  # @argument grading_period_id [Integer]
  #   Return grades for the given grading_period.  If this parameter is not
  #   specified, the returned grades will be for the whole course.
  #
  # @argument sis_account_id[] [String]
  #   Returns only enrollments for the specified SIS account ID(s). Does not
  #   look into subaccounts. May pass in array or string.
  #
  # @argument sis_course_id[] [String]
  #   Returns only enrollments matching the specified SIS course ID(s).
  #   May pass in array or string.
  #
  # @argument sis_section_id[] [String]
  #   Returns only section enrollments matching the specified SIS section ID(s).

  # @API Enroll a user
  # Create a new user enrollment for a course or section.

  #   The ID of the user to be enrolled in the course.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[type] [Required, String, "StudentEnrollment"|"TeacherEnrollment"|"TaEnrollment"|"ObserverEnrollment"|"DesignerEnrollment"]
  #   Enroll the user as a student, teacher, TA, observer, or designer. If no
  #   value is given, the type will be inferred by enrollment[role] if supplied,
  #   otherwise 'StudentEnrollment' will be used.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[role] [Deprecated, String]
  #   Assigns a custom course-level role to the user.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[role_id] [Integer]
  #   Assigns a custom course-level role to the user.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[enrollment_state] [String, "active"|"invited"|"inactive"]
  #   If set to 'active,' student will be immediately enrolled in the course.
  #   Otherwise they will be required to accept a course invitation. Default is
  #   'invited.'.
  #
  #   If set to 'inactive', student will be listed in the course roster for
  #   teachers, but will not be able to participate in the course until
  #   their enrollment is activated.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[course_section_id] [Integer]
  #   The ID of the course section to enroll the student in. If the
  #   section-specific URL is used, this argument is redundant and will be
  #   ignored.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[limit_privileges_to_course_section] [Boolean]
  #   If set, the enrollment will only allow the user to see and interact with
  #   users enrolled in the section given by course_section_id.
  #   * For teachers and TAs, this includes grading privileges.
  #   * Section-limited students will not see any users (including teachers
  #     and TAs) not enrolled in their sections.
  #   * Users may have other enrollments that grant privileges to
  #     multiple sections in the same course.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[notify] [Boolean]
  #   If true, a notification will be sent to the enrolled user.
  #   Notifications are not sent by default.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[self_enrollment_code] [String]
  #   If the current user is not allowed to manage enrollments in this
  #   course, but the course allows self-enrollment, the user can self-
  #   enroll as a student in the default section by passing in a valid
  #   code. When self-enrolling, the user_id must be 'self'. The
  #   enrollment_state will be set to 'active' and all other arguments
  #   will be ignored.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[self_enrolled] [Boolean]
  #   If true, marks the enrollment as a self-enrollment, which gives
  #   students the ability to drop the course if desired. Defaults to false.
  #
  # @argument enrollment[associated_user_id] [Integer]
  #   For an observer enrollment, the ID of a student to observe. The
  #   caller must have +manage_students+ permission in the course.
  #   This is a one-off operation; to automatically observe all a
  #   student's enrollments (for example, as a parent), please use
  #   the {api:UserObserveesController#create User Observees API}.
