# @API Authentications Log
#
# Query audit log of authentication events (logins and logouts).
#
# Only available if the server has configured audit logs; will return 404 Not
# Found response otherwise.
#
# For each endpoint, a compound document is returned. The primary collection of
# event objects is paginated, ordered by date descending. Secondary collections
# of logins, accounts, page views, and users related to the returned events
# are also included. Refer to the Logins, Accounts, Page Views, and Users APIs
# for descriptions of the objects in those collections.
