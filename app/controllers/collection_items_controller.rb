# @API Collections
# @beta
#
# Collections contain Collection Items, which are links to content. There are
# different types of items for links to different types of data.
#
# Collection items can be cloned from other collection items. This way the
# original source of the item can be tracked, and a count of "re-posts" can be
# kept on each item to track popularity. Note that depending on where the
# original item came from, a user may be able to view the cloned item but not
# the original item.
#
# A collection item also has a Discussion Topic associated with it, which can be
# used for comments on the item. See the Discussion Topic API for details on
# querying and adding to a discussion. The scope for the discussion topic will
# be the collection item, and the id of the topic is "self". For example, the
# DiscussionTopicsApiController#view endpoint looks like this:
#
#     /api/v1/collection_items/<id>/discussion_topics/self/view
#
# @object Collection Item
#
#     {
#       // The ID of the collection item.
#       id: 7,
#
#       // The ID of the collection that this item belongs to.
#       collection_id: 2,
#
#       // The type of the item.
#       // Currently defined types are: "url", "image", "audio", and "video".
#       //
#       // Canvas may define new item types at any time. "url" is the most
#       // generic type, and just means any sort of web link. If an api consumer
#       // sees an item_type that it doesn't yet know how to handle, treating it
#       // as a "url" is a safe bet.
#       //
#       // "image", "audio" and "video" are URLs either directly to a file of that mime type, or
#       // to a web page that was determined to contain that type as its main content.
#       item_type: "url",
#
#       // The link to the item. For item type of "url", this is the entire
#       // contents of the collection item. For other item types, this may be a
#       // web preview or other representation of the item data.
#       link_url: "https://example.com/some/path",
#
#       // The number of posts of this item, including the original. This count
#       // is shared between the original item and all clones.
#       post_count: 2,
#
#       // The number of users who have voted up this item. This count is
#       // shared between the original item and all clones.
#       upvote_count: 3,
#
#       // Boolean indicating whether this user has upvoted this item (or any of its clones)
#       upvoted_by_user: false,
#
#       // If this item was cloned from another item, this will be the ID of
#       // the first, original item that all clones are derived from.
#       // In other words, if item 7 was cloned from item 5, and
#       // 5 was cloned from item 3, and 3 is the original, then the
#       // root_item_id of items 7, 5 and 3 will all be 3.
#       root_item_id: 3,
#
#       // An image representation of the collection item. This will be in a
#       // common web format such as png or jpeg. The resolution and geometry may depend on
#       // the item, but Canvas will attempt to make it 640 pixels wide
#       // when possible.
#       image_url: "https://<canvas>/files/item_image.png",
#
#       // If true, the image for this item is still being processed and
#       // image_url will be null. Check back later.
#       // If image_url is null but image_pending is false, the item has no image.
#       image_pending: false,
#
#       // The title of the item.
#       title: "My Image",
#
#       // The description of the item. This is plain text.
#       description: "some block of plain text",
#
#       // Any user-provided comments on the item. A user can add their own
#       // comments when cloning an existing item. This is plain text.
#       user_comment: "some block of plain text",
#
#       // A snippet of HTML that can be used as an in-line preview of the
#       // item. For example, a link to a youtube page may have an iframe inline
#       // embed of the video.
#       // If no preview is available, this field will be null.
