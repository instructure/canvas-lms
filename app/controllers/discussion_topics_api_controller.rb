  end

  # @API Get the full topic
  # Return a cached structure of the discussion topic, containing all entries,
  # their authors, and their message bodies.
  #
  # May require (depending on the topic) that the user has posted in the topic.
  # If it is required, and the user has not posted, will respond with a 403
  # Forbidden status and the body 'require_initial_post'.
  #
  # In some rare situations, this cached structure may not be available yet. In
  # that case, the server will respond with a 503 error, and the caller should
  # try again soon.
  #
  # The response is an object containing the following keys:
  # * "participants": A list of summary information on users who have posted to
  #   the discussion. Each value is an object containing their id, display_name,
  #   and avatar_url.
  # * "unread_entries": A list of entry ids that are unread by the current
  #   user. this implies that any entry not in this list is read.
  # * "entry_ratings": A map of entry ids to ratings by the current user. Entries
  #   not in this list have no rating. Only populated if rating is enabled.
  # * "forced_entries": A list of entry ids that have forced_read_state set to
  #   true. This flag is meant to indicate the entry's read_state has been
  #   manually set to 'unread' by the user, so the entry should not be
  #   automatically marked as read.
  # * "view": A threaded view of all the entries in the discussion, containing
  #   the id, user_id, and message.
  # * "new_entries": Because this view is eventually consistent, it's possible
  #   that newly created or updated entries won't yet be reflected in the view.
  #   If the application wants to also get a flat list of all entries not yet
  #   reflected in the view, pass include_new_entries=1 to the request and this
  #   array of entries will be returned. These entries are returned in a flat
  #   array, in ascending created_at order.
