# @API Collections
#
# @beta
#
# Collections are buckets of content that can be used to organize links to
# helpful resources. For instance, a user could create a collection storing a
# set of links to various web sites containing potential discussion questions,
# or members of a group could all contribute to a collection focused on
# potential assessment questions.
#
# A user/group can have multiple collections, and each can be marked as private
# (viewable only to the user/group) or public (viewable by the world).
#
# Group collections can only be created, updated, or deleted by group
# moderators.
#
# @object Collection
#     {
#       // The ID of the collection.
#       "id": 5,
#
#       // The display name of the collection, set by the collection creator.
#       "name": "My Collection",
#
#       // The visibility of the collection. If "public", the collection is
#       // visible to everybody, and can be followed.  If "private", the
#       // collection is visible only to the creating user.
#       // The default is "private".
#       "visibility": "public",
#
#       // Boolean indicating whether this user is following this collection.
#       "followed_by_user": false,
#

#       "followers_count": 10,
#
#       // The number of items in this collection.
