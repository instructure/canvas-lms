  #   See {Appendix: Group assignments} for more info.

  #   override.
  #
  # @argument assignment_override[due_at] [Timestamp, Optional] The day/time
  #   the overridden assignment is due. Accepts times in ISO 8601 format, e.g.
  #   2011-10-21T18:48Z. If absent, this override will not affect due date. May
  #   be present but null to indicate the override removes any previous due
  #   date.

  #   the overridden assignment becomes unlocked. Accepts times in ISO 8601

  #   the unlock date. May be present but null to indicate the override removes
