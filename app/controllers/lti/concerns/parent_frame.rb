# Methods for controller actions which take a parent_frame_context param to
# facilitate embedding inside trusted tools (e.g. New Quizzes). Depending on
# the action then may need to one or both of these things:
# 1. Set the origin to be used with postMessage to allow the embedded tool to
#    send messages to the embedding (trusted) tool (usually set in js_env to
#    the value of parent_frame_origin)
# 2. Add the embedding tool's host to the Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
#    header's frame-ancestor directive to allow the page to me loaded in an
#    iframe embedded in the embedding tool. For this, call
#    set_extra_csp_frame_ancestor!
