# @API Moderated Grading
# @subtopic Provisional Grades
#
# API for manipulating provisional grades
#
# Provisional grades are created by using the Submissions API endpoint "Grade or comment on a submission" with `provisional=true`.
# They can be viewed by using "List assignment submissions", "Get a single submission", or "List gradeable students" with `include[]=provisional_grades`.
# This API performs other operations on provisional grades for use with the Moderated Grading feature.
