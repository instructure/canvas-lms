# @API Announcements
#
# API for retrieving announcements.  This API is Announcement-specific.
# See also the Discussion Topics API, which operates on Announcements also.

class AnnouncementsApiController < ApplicationController
  include Api::V1::DiscussionTopics

  before_action :parse_context_codes, only: [:index]
  before_action :get_dates, only: [:index]

  # @API List announcements
  #
  # Returns the paginated list of announcements for the given courses and date range.  Note that
  # a +context_code+ field is added to the responses so you can tell which course each announcement
  # belongs to.
  #
  # @argument context_codes[] [Required]
  #   List of context_codes to retrieve announcements for (for example, +course_123+). Only courses
  #   are presently supported. The call will fail unless the caller has View Announcements permission
  #   in all listed courses.
  # @argument start_date [Optional, Date]
  #   Only return announcements posted since the start_date (inclusive).
  #   Defaults to 14 days ago. The value should be formatted as: yyyy-mm-dd or ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
  # @argument end_date [Optional, Date]
  #   Only return announcements posted before the end_date (inclusive).
  #   Defaults to 28 days from start_date. The value should be formatted as: yyyy-mm-dd or ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
  #   Announcements scheduled for future posting will only be returned to course administrators.
  # @argument active_only [Optional, Boolean]
  #   Only return active announcements that have been published.
  #   Applies only to requesting users that have permission to view
  #   unpublished items.
  #   Defaults to false for users with access to view unpublished items,
  #   otherwise true and unmodifiable.
  # @argument latest_only [Optional, Boolean]
  #   Only return the latest announcement for each associated context.
  #   The response will include at most one announcement for each
  #   specified context in the context_codes[] parameter.
  #   Defaults to false.
  #
  # @argument include [Optional, array]
  #   Optional list of resources to include with the response. May include
  #   a string of the name of the resource. Possible values are:
  #   "sections", "sections_user_count"
  #   if "sections" is passed, includes the course sections that are associated
  #   with the topic, if the topic is specific to certain sections of the course.
  #   If "sections_user_count" is passed, then:
  #     (a) If sections were asked for *and* the topic is specific to certain
  #         course sections sections, includes the number of users in each
  #         section. (as part of the section json asked for above)
  #     (b) Else, includes at the root level the total number of users in the
  #         topic's context (group or course) that the topic applies to.
  # @example_request
  #     curl https://<canvas>/api/v1/announcements?context_codes[]=course_1&context_codes[]=course_2 \
