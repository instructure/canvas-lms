# @API Submissions
#
# API for accessing and updating submissions for an assignment. The submission
# id in these URLs is the id of the student in the course, there is no separate
# submission id exposed in these APIs.
#
# All submission actions can be performed with either the course id, or the
# course section id. SIS ids can be used, prefixed by "sis_course_id:" or
# "sis_section_id:" as described in the API documentation on SIS IDs.

  #
  # @API Grade or comment on a submission
  #
  # Comment on and/or update the grading for a student's assignment submission.
  # If any submission or rubric_assessment arguments are provided, the user
  # must have permission to manage grades in the appropriate context (course or
  # section).
  #
  # @argument comment[text_comment] [Optional, String]
  #   Add a textual comment to the submission.
  #
  # @argument comment[group_comment] [Optional, Boolean]
  #   Whether or not this comment should be sent to the entire group (defaults
  #   to false). Ignored if this is not a group assignment or if no text_comment
  #   is provided.
  #
  # @argument comment[media_comment_id] [Optional, String]
  #   Add an audio/video comment to the submission. Media comments can be added
  #   via this API, however, note that there is not yet an API to generate or
  #   list existing media comments, so this functionality is currently of
  #   limited use.
  #
  # @argument comment[media_comment_type] [Optional, String, "audio"|"video"]
  #   The type of media comment being added.
  #
  # @argument comment[file_ids][] [Optional,Integer]
  #   Attach files to this comment that were previously uploaded using the
  #   Submission Comment API's files action
  #
  # @argument submission[posted_grade] [Optional, String]
  #   Assign a score to the submission, updating both the "score" and "grade"
  #   fields on the submission record. This parameter can be passed in a few
  #   different formats:
  #
  #   points:: A floating point or integral value, such as "13.5". The grade
  #     will be interpreted directly as the score of the assignment.
  #     Values above assignment.points_possible are allowed, for awarding
  #     extra credit.
  #   percentage:: A floating point value appended with a percent sign, such as
  #      "40%". The grade will be interpreted as a percentage score on the
  #      assignment, where 100% == assignment.points_possible. Values above 100%
  #      are allowed, for awarding extra credit.
  #   letter grade:: A letter grade, following the assignment's defined letter
  #      grading scheme. For example, "A-". The resulting score will be the high
  #      end of the defined range for the letter grade. For instance, if "B" is
  #      defined as 86% to 84%, a letter grade of "B" will be worth 86%. The
  #      letter grade will be rejected if the assignment does not have a defined
  #      letter grading scheme. For more fine-grained control of scores, pass in
  #      points or percentage rather than the letter grade.
  #   "pass/complete/fail/incomplete":: A string value of "pass" or "complete"
  #      will give a score of 100%. "fail" or "incomplete" will give a score of
  #      0.
  #
  #   Note that assignments with grading_type of "pass_fail" can only be
  #   assigned a score of 0 or assignment.points_possible, nothing inbetween. If
  #   a posted_grade in the "points" or "percentage" format is sent, the grade
  #   will only be accepted if the grade equals one of those two values.
  #
  # @argument rubric_assessment [Optional, RubricAssessment]
  #   Assign a rubric assessment to this assignment submission. The
  #   sub-parameters here depend on the rubric for the assignment. The general
  #   format is, for each row in the rubric:
  #
  #   rubric_assessment[criterion_id][points]:: The points awarded for this row.
  #   rubric_assessment[criterion_id][comments]:: Comments to add for this row.
  #
  #   For example, if the assignment rubric is (in JSON format):
  #     !!!javascript
  #     [
  #       {
  #         'id': 'crit1',
  #         'points': 10,
  #         'description': 'Criterion 1',
  #         'ratings':
  #         [
  #           { 'description': 'Good', 'points': 10 },
  #           { 'description': 'Poor', 'points': 3 }
  #         ]
  #       },
  #       {
  #         'id': 'crit2',
  #         'points': 5,
  #         'description': 'Criterion 2',
  #         'ratings':
  #         [
  #           { 'description': 'Complete', 'points': 5 },
  #           { 'description': 'Incomplete', 'points': 0 }
  #         ]
  #       }
  #     ]
  #
  #   Then a possible set of values for rubric_assessment would be:
  #       rubric_assessment[crit1][points]=3&rubric_assessment[crit2][points]=5&rubric_assessment[crit2][comments]=Well%20Done.
